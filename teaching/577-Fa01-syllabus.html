<H3>Introduction</H3>

The class will focus on information architecture and project management in the design and 
management of complex web sites. This course builds on L571: Informaiton Architecture for 
the Web, and addresses aspects of large-scale web design and management that are not covered 
in that class.
<p>
The main texts will be Rosenfeld and Morevilles' <i>Information architecture for the web: 
Designing large-scale web sites</i> and Burdman's <i>Collaborative web development: Strategies
and best practices for web teams</i>. The readings from these texts will be supplemented 
with additional readings, many of which will be available on the web. In addition, there 
will be presentations from several information architects and project managers who have 
worked on teams developing complex web sites.
<p>
On the first day of class, students will be divided into teams. Each team will then spend 
the semester studying a complex web site in a local organization. This project has four 
components. First, teams will conduct an inventory of the site, describing the hardware 
and software that are used to develop and maintain the site.
<p>
Second, teams will conduct a socio-technical analysis of the site. This will involve 
determining the context and purposes of the web site in the organization. Through interviews 
with people in the organization and observation of the site, teams will learn about the site. 
They will learn about the roles the site is intended to play in the organization, They will 
ascertain who the major stakeholders are in the organization and the goals that they have 
for the site. They will describe the work flow involved in maintaining the site focusing 
on the main tasks of the people who are responsible for site design and development.
<p>
Third, teams will describe the current information architecture of the site, focusing on 
its high level structure. This will involve a description of the organization of the site's 
content, labeling system, navigation scheme, and other functions.
<p>
Fourth, teams will develop a realistic project plan for redesign of a portion of the site 
or the design of a new section. This will be a realistic plan that will contain a well-thought 
out and appropriate set of steps to be taken by the organization. This will involve 
consideration of the changes that would improve the structure and functions of the site. 
The team will also consider and account for the financial, technical and personnel 
requirements necessary to carry out the plan. To do this, teams may consider redefining 
the organization's goals for the site or its audience, changing the hardware and/or software 
configurations, changing the workflow and job responsibilities, or perhaps redesigning the 
information architecture.
<p>
In each stage, team members visit and interview the people working on the site. In addition 
to the description of the current state of affairs, teams make recommendations for improvement. 
Each section leads to a chapter in the final design and development report that is turned in 
as the final project and delivered to the client. This project is completed when the planning 
document is delivered to us. Teams are not responsible for implementing the plan, although 
they may wish to develop prototypes to illustrate what they have proposed in the plan.

<p>
<font size="2">return to <a href="#10">table</a></font>
<p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

This course is intended to accommodate students of many different backgrounds,
and is not restricted to students in the School of Library and Information 
Science. However, as this class makes extensive use of the  Internet and 
World Wide Web, students enrolling in this course should have a strong 
familiarity with the use of the Internet and World Wide Web, and 
should be comfortable working with HTML for web page design. SLIS students should 
have takenL571 or L548 before enrolling in this course.
<p>
If you have a question about whether or not your computing background
is sufficient, please ask us and we'll tell you.
<p>
<h3>Course Requirements</h3>

This course is run as a seminar, which means that the success or failure of the 
class depends, to a great extent, on your participation throughout the semester. 
The class will not be run in a lecture format after the first class and will 
thereafter involve discussions and active interchanges among the people in the 
class. This means that you have a greater responsibility to take control of your 
own education, both in and outside of class. In class, you should be prepared to 
discuss the topics that are scheduled for each afternoon. Outside of class, you 
should make the time to read and think about the material placed on reserve. 
<p>
Although the syllabus follows a predetermined schedule, the seminar format provides 
a degree of flexibility that will allow the class to spend more time on those topics 
that are capturing our interest. The course content can therefore evolve as we begin 
to explore information architecture, project management and related issues.
<p>
To receive a passing grade in this course, you must turn in all of the
assignments and the term project and do your presentation. You cannot pass 
this course without doing all of the assigned work, however, turning in all of
the work is not a guarantee that you will pass the course.  
<p>
Grades of &lt;<b>I</b>&gt; (Incomplete) may be assigned in this course after discussion 
with the instructor, but, depending on the circumstances, there will be a penalty 
applied at the discretion of the instructors.
<p>
All papers and assignments must be submitted on the dates specified in this 
syllabus. If you cannot submit an assignment or cannot deliver a presentation 
on the date it is due, it is your responsibility to discuss your situation with 
the instructor, preferably in advance. Given that your reasons or problems are 
legitimate, arrangements for the completion of the outstanding work can be 
made; this will occur, however, at the discretion of the instructor.  There 
will be a penalty for work turned in after the assigned date, and this will 
also be applied at the discretion of the instructors.
<p>
Your written, web-based, and oral work will be evaluated according to four 
criteria; it must:
<ul>
<li>Be clearly written, marked up, and/or presented, and spell- and grammar-checked;
<p>
<li>Demonstrate a degree of insight into the concepts, issues, and trends in 
both the areas you investigate in the assignments and in the course content;
<p>
<li>Demonstrate a degree of originality in your reviews, analyses and 
projects; and
<p>
<li>Display some familiarity with the appropriate current and/or classic
literatures where appropriate.
</ul>
<p>
Borderline grades will be decided (up or down) on the basis of class contributions 
and participation throughout the semester. 
<p>
Indiana University and School of Library and Information Science policies on 
academic dishonesty will be followed. Students found to be engaging in 
plagiarism, cheating, and other types of dishonesty will receive an <b>F</b> 
for the course. As a rule of thumb, when in doubt, cite the source!
<p>
The following definitions of letter grades have been defined by student and 
faculty members of the Committee on Improvement of Instruction and have been 
approved by the faculty (November 11,1996) as an aid in evaluation of academic 
performance and to assist students by giving them an understanding of the 
grading standards of the School of Library and Information Science:

Select a topic from the syllabus in which you have interest and prepare a 15-minute 
presentation that you will deliver on the date when that topic is being discussed in 
class. You will investigate this topic in some depth and be prepared to lead a discussion 
in class.
<p>
Your presentation will be web-based, using web pages, Powerpoint saved as HTML or some 
other appropriate presentation software. When you present, you may also use notes, an 
outline, and any supporting materials. When you lead the discussion, you should be 
prepared to talk about the topic and the readings, raising questions that will serve 
as the basis for our discussion. We will arrange to have a computer and projector 
available in class; if you need any other technology for your presentation, let us know 
and we will arrange to have them in the class for your session. 
<p>
You will also write a 5-7 page essay on the topic that you will submit to us on the day 
that you present in class. This essay can be used as the basis for your presentation.
<p>
There are two tasks you have to prepare the class for your presentation. First, you will 
provide us with at least two print or web-based readings that you want the class to read 
in advance of the discussion. No later than three days before you are scheduled to lead 
the discussion, you will provide one of us with paper or digital copies of the readings.  
We will make copies of any readings, place them on reserve in the SLIS Library, and alert 
the class that the readings are available by posting messages to the class list. If you 
want to use web sites, please post the URLs to the class list at least three days before 
the class.
<p>
Second, to seed the discussion, you will prepare three general discussion questions that 
are based on the readings or web pages that you have selected and post them to the class 
list hrosenba_infodesign@indiana.edu no later than three days in advance of the class 
discussion you lead. 
<p>
After the class, you will submit the URL of your presentation and your written essay to 
us.
<p>
You complete this assignment by providing us with readings, preparing the discussion 
questions and posting them on the class list, preparing your online presentation, showing 
up in class, leading the discussion, and turning in your essay and any other supporting 
materials. 
<p>
You will sign up for topics on <b>September 4</b>. We plan to have two presentations in 
each class between <b>September 25</b> and <b>November 27</b>. This assignment is worth 
<b>25 points</b> apportioned as follows: in class presentation Ð <b>5 points</b>; essay

There is a small portion of the overall grade that has been allocated for class 
participation.  For the purposes of this class, participation is defined as contributing 
to class discussion or demonstrating in other ways that you are making an effort to succeed 
in this class.  In addition, as a professional, you will be expected to articulate your 
ideas in both written and oral form, therefore it is important that you think critically 
and present your ideas throughout the duration of the class.

<p>
Note that there is a portion of the overall grade that has been allocated for class 
participation. Participation will be determined in two main ways. One will involve a 
demonstration of your effort and interest in class. Since this class is run as seminar, 
participation in this sense is defined primarily as contributing to class discussion, 
although there are also ways to demonstrate that you are engaged in the class, such as 
coming by during office hours to discuss your work or ask questions.
