<P>
        The representation and organization of information resources is a
primary focus of the information profession.  Organizational structures
such as classification schemes, indexes, bibliographies and catalogs have
been devised to provide access not only to the document, but to its
intellectual content - the knowledge or information recorded in the
document.  The recent explosive growth in both the number and the variety
of information resources serves to underscore the continuing need for
application of effective methods of representation and organization.
<P>
        Practical and effective systems of information representation and
organization must depend upon a comprehensive understanding not only of
the theoretical foundations of bibliographic organization but also of the
basic principles of human cognition.  Accordingly, this course will
investigate the basic principles and theoretical foundations of
traditional organizational schemes.  This investigation will include
materials from traditional librarianship, information science, cognitive
science, semiotics, and artificial intelligence and expert systems that
have contributed to an understanding of how people obtain, store,
retrieve and use information.  It will also examine how research in these
areas can inform current practices of representation and organization in
the design of more effective and more efficient information retrieval
systems.
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">Course Objectives</an></H1>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
To introduce the student to a broad range of knowledge
representation models drawn from the fields of information science,
communication, semiotics, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and
artificial intelligence.

To develop in the student the ability to understand and
effectively apply principles of representation and organization currently
used to provide access to information resources.
<LI>
To provide practical experience in applying the basic
principles of knowledge organization and representation to the indexing,
abstracting and classification of information in several media.
<LI>
To enable the student to analyze information resources
for hypertext indexing.
<LI>

the function of subject analysis in indexing and classification.
<LI>
To provide the student with an understanding of the
development and application of controlled vocabularies and syndetic
structures.

information.
</OL><H1><an NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">Class Organization</an></H1>
<P>
The structure of each class session will center around lectures by the
instructor, group presentations, and class discussions. Lecture, presentations, 
and discussions will cover the topic for the session as 
indicated on the syllabus. Students are strongly encouraged to 
participate actively in all lectures and discussions since each student's
participation in class activities will constitute 1/3 of his/her final grade.
During the first session students will form teams. Each team will compose an
electronic journal for the class and prepare a presentation 
for one class session (see below).
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">Required Readings</an></H1>
<P>
There is no required text for this class. However, the text listed below
will be available in the IMU bookstore, in case you would like to purchase it.
<P>
Iyer, Hemalata. (1995). <I>Classificatory structures: Concepts, 
relations and representation</I>. Frankfurt am Main: Indeks Verlag.
<P>
A copy of this book is on Reserve in the SLIS library, as are copies of
other assigned readings. The Class Schedule (contained in this 
handout) lists the other readings. It is required 
that every student completes every week's readings before the class meeting.
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">Grading</an></H1>
<P>
The grades are given according to the SLIS grading standards. 
Good work that meets the course expectations will be assigned 
a grade of B. To get a higher grade than B, the students must
demonstrate above average comprehension of the course materials,
knowledge and/or effort.
<P>
The final course grade will be computed for each student on the basis 
of grades assigned for the following:
<P>
<table BORDER=3> <P ALIGN=CENTER>
<tr><td> Class contribution and listserv discussion <td> 1/3
<tr><td> Team project: journal and presentation <td> 1/3
<tr><td> Final exam <td> 1/3
</table>

<P>
Each student is expected to complete all course work by the end of the term.
A grade of incomplete (I) will be assigned only if exceptional 
circumstances warrant.
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">Class contribution and listserv discussions</an></H1>
<P>
Class contribution does not mean attendance, but the quality and quantity
of contributions to the work of the class. Comments and questions are 
equally valuable if they help to clarify the topics 
and to move the discussion forward. The assignments and readings
of each week must be completed before the class meeting so that 
substantive and meaningful contributions from the students are possible. 
It is required that every student demonstrate respect for the ideas,
opinions, and feelings of all other members of the class.
<P>
<P>
<P>
A majordomo distribution list will be used to communicate about course
matters. The students should send comments and questions concerning the
reading materials to this list. Participation in the listserv discussions
will be counted towards class participation, i.e. students who do not
like to speak up in class can contribute their ideas via the listserv. 
It is recommended that all students check their email at least 
three times a week for messages to the distribution list.
The distribution list is <B>priss_l505@indiana.edu</B>.
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">Team project: journal and presentation</an></H1>
<P>
In the first session the students will form teams of two members each. 
Each team will
compile an electronic journal which they make available on the Internet.
(If a team consists of students who have not taken or waived L401, they
can compose a typewritten journal instead. The form of the journal,
electronic or printed, has to be determined during the first class session.)
Only the content and the completeness of the journal and not the
graphical design of the pages or the html encoding will be graded.
Although the design will not be graded, it is expected that the journals
are spell-checked and written in a style which is appropriate for 
publication on the Internet.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The journal must at least contain
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
A title page with names of the team members, name of the class,
a list of contents of the journal, and a one paragraph introduction.
All other pages must be linked to this page.
<LI>
An informative abstract, discussion, or summary of each assigned
reading and three index terms (keywords) for each assigned reading. 
Each entry for an assigned reading must include full citation
information and the name of the team member who wrote the abstract.
<LI>
Short essays, lists, etc. according to the assignments of each week.
If an assignment is labeled &quot;individual&quot;, each team member has to 
write the assignment individually and add it to the journal. 
Each assignment must carry a heading which indicates the class session
to which the assignment belongs and the team member who compiled it.
<LI> 
A faceted classification scheme for the assigned readings.
(Compare the assignment for session 8.)
<LI>
An index for the assigned readings which consists of the index terms
of the assigned readings. 
(Compare the assignment for session 9.)
<LI>
A thesaurus for the topics of the class that contains the index terms
of the assigned readings. (Compare the assignment for session 11.)
</UL>
<P>
Optional journal entries may include: (Each optional entry must contain
a heading and the name(s) of the team member(s) who created it.)
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Review and assessment of ideas presented in class lectures and discussions.
<LI>
Summaries of other relevant readings.
<LI>
Questions raised by readings, class lectures or discussions.
</UL>
<P>
The students are encouraged to read the journals of other students
and to discuss the topics with them. 
Journals will be evaluated by the instructor at three separate
points during the semester (The day following session 5, session 9, 
and session 13).
At each review, a letter grade for each individual student 
will be assigned based on
<UL>
<LI>
completeness of the journal,
<LI>
continuous additional effort (for grades better than B),
<LI>
evidence
of active intellectual involvement with the subject content of the course.
</UL>
<P>
The final journal grade will be computed as an average of the three
review grades.
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">Group presentation</an></H1>
<P>
During the first class session each team will get
a topic assigned that is related to one session. 
The topics consist of a subject or subject area, such as
a certain classification system or a certain aspect of thesaurus research.
The team will prepare a list of references for the topic, study 
the structures of information or knowledge contained in the topic, and
apply the terms and concepts learned from this course to the topic.
The team will give a 20 to 30 minute presentation on the topic which
will highlight the important features of the topic and
present the results of the team's analysis, including a critical
evaluation of the subject.  
Handouts of 1 or 2 pages containing the outline of the talk, 
the main statements and the references will be prepared.
<P>
The groups are recommended to 
consult the instructor several times throughout the semester
to clarify questions and to discuss details of the topic.
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION00090000000000000000">Final Exam</an></H1>
<P>
The final exam will be a take-home exam consisting of 4
essay questions and will be distributed at the conclusion of class session
12. It will be due at the beginning of the class session 14.
<P>
<H1><an NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">A note on plagiarism</an></H1>
<P>
The students must clearly indicate if they use materials from
other sources, such as textbooks or Internet webpages. Full citation
information must be given for such sources. The entries of the journal
must contain information on the authors, i.e.
whether they have been written by all members
of the team or by an individual member. 
Academic and personal misconduct by students in this class are defined
and dealt with according to the
procedures in the <I>Code of Student Ethics</I>.
