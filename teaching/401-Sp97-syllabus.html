<H2>Course Description</H2>
This course will be an introduction to fundamental concepts of and techniques
related to computer-based information tools, computer platforms, major classes
of microcomputer application software, online information retrieval, general
networking, and the Internet. This course is a prerequisite for participation
at SLIS, and understanding of the materials therein should be considered
critical for current and future information professionals and librarians.
The knowledge and experience gained in this course will also prepare SLIS
students for participation in other technology-intensive SLIS courses in
which these fundamental skills will be taken to higher levels. 
<HR>

<H2>Course Objectives</H2>

<H2>Grading</H2>
Since this course is skills-based, we are proposing to have it graded on a
pass/fail basis. If this should not be approved by the Curriculum Steering 
Committee and the IU administration you would get a letter grade
based on the following: 
<UL>
<LI>Attendance of & Participation in the Lab Sections: 10% 
<LI>Exam 1 (take-home): 20% 
<LI>Exam 2 (take-home): 20% 
<LI>Assignments: 50% 
</UL>

The decision about the pass/fail grading will be made during the semester.
Passing the course will be equivalent to a minimum grade of B. If you 
for some reason need a letter grade, please contact the instructor.

<HR>

<H2>Readings</H2>

The assigned readings for each
week should be completed before lectures to which they belong.
As this is a skills-based class, the emphasis of the class is not
upon reading, but upon performing and understanding the tasks and tools
discussed. However, readings that will supplement the material significantly
will be used and discussed. The readings that are marked `optional' 
are recommended for students who want to carry on and learn more about the
topics than the lecture and labs provide. 
The content of these readings will not be necessary for 
participating in the class or for accomplishing the assignments.<p>

<H2>Assignments</H2>
Assignments will be of a practical nature, allowing the student to demonstrate
the skills discussed and practiced in the class. The assignments will be
distributed through the Email Distribution List (see below) and will
be published on this page. <br>

Each assignment is due by the beginning of the next lab. 
Assignments will not be accepted late unless arrangements with the instructor
are made in advance.

<H2>Electronic Communications</H2>

<H3>Email Distribution Lists</H3>

The instructional team will use a majordomo distribution list to 
distribute the assignments and to
communicate with students about 
course matters.  In addition, the distribution list may be used to 
facilitate intra-class communication.  The 
distribution list is priss_l401@indiana.edu</I>.
