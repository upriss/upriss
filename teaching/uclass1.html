<h1>Unix Workshop</h1>

<font color=red>Note: please be careful with commands such as "rm" or commands 
that you not fully understand. Don't execute such commands in a 
directory that contains important files. The instructor will not
be responsible for lost or damaged files.
<p>
In general it is a good idea to create a .trash directory and to
alias rm as "mv !^ /home/user_name/.trash". To empty the .trash 
directory you need to reset the alias of rm to rm. 
Other simpler options are aliasing cp, mv, rm by their -i options
and safety features in the login files, such as
"set noclobber" in .cshrc.

<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
Do the following things using as few commands as possible!
(Write down the commands you use.)
Create one directory called abe
with a subdirectory homer that contains the files bart, lisa and maggie.
Create another directory called marge that contains files that are
called bart, lisa and maggie and that are linked to homer's files.
Write a sentence into each of the three files (use "echo" to do this). 
Create another directory called simpson and move everything else there.
Compare marge and homer to see whether their files are identical. 
Remove everything except an empty directory "marge". 

<h4>Displaying information about files</h4>

<table border=1>
<tr><td> ls   <td>
	<li> ls -a (show hidden files)
	<li> ls -l (long listing)
	<li> ls -ld (directory without contents)
	<li> ls -i (inode: shows hard links) 
	<li> ls -R (recursive)
	<li> ls -ct (sort by last time modified)
	<li> ls -ut (sort by last time accessed)
	<li> ls -p (adds / after directories)
	<li> ls -F (adds /, *, @)
<tr><td> file   <td> (shows file type (sometimes)) 
<tr><td> wc   <td> (counts lines words characters)
<tr><td> which <td> (finds programs according to paths and aliases)
<tr><td> find   <td>
	<li> p 309
	<li> find pathname expression
	<li> find . -name "*.txt" -print
	<li> find . ! -name "*.???" -print
	<li> find . \( -name "*.??" -o -name "*.???" \) -print
	<li> find . -size +2 -print  (more than 2 blocks)
	<li> find . -exec ls -ld {} \;
	<li> find . -name "*.bak" -exec rm {} \; (dangerous!)
	<li> find . -name "*.bak" -ok rm {} \;  (safer)
	<li> find . -atime -n -print (accessed less than n days ago)
	<li> find . -mtime -n -print (modified less than n days ago)
	<li> find . -ctime -n -print (accessed or modified less than n days ago)
	<li> find $HOME -ctime -7 -type f -print 
	<li> (shows regular files that were accessed or modified less than 7 days ago)
	<li> find / -user "stan" -print
	<li> find / -user 25 -print
	<li> find / -group "sys" -print
	<li> find / -type f - perm 0744 -print
</table>

last files accessed/changed? Execute "ls -lut" then "ls -R" and then one
miute later "ls -lut" again: what do you notice? 
<br>
b) Which of your files in one directory contains the most characters?
<br>

<h4>Displaying file content</h4>

<table border=1>
<tr><td> cat   <td>
	<li> cat file1 file2 > file3
	<li> cat -n  (prints line numbers)
	<li> cat -r  (don't print multiple blank lines)

<tr><td> more   <td>
<tr><td> head   <td> 
	head [-count] [file1 file2 ...]
<tr><td> tail   <td> 
	<li> tail +|-[count][lbc] file
	<li> tail -f file (used to check on a file being built)
</table>

<p>
<b>Exercises</b>

<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
a) Try the different ps options. Type "more &" then "pico &"
then "ps -l". Which of the
processes is the parent? What is the id of the parent process?
In what states are the processes?
<p>
b) Type "jobs". Then bring the "more" process into the foreground.
Find the process id of the "pico" process and kill it.
<p>
c) Type "emacs". Then put the process into the background using a 
second terminal window. Then kill the emacs process.
<p>
d) Find out what the current time is. Using "at" echo "hello" to
a new file to be executed exactly 2 minutes later.
