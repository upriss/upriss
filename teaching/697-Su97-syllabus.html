<H1>Introduction</H1>

Formal Concept Analysis is a fast-growing, relatively new field. It was
introduced by Rudolf Wille in 1982. Since then more than 250 papers on the
subject have been published, including several textbooks and conference 
proceedings. It provides a  method
of formal data analysis which has successfully been applied to many
fields, such as medicine and psychology, musicology, linguistic databases,
library and information science, software re-engineering, civil engineering, 
ecology, and others. 
(An extensive bibliography of Formal Concept Analysis
can be found <An href="../fca/ba8090.html">
here</an>.)
A main advantage of Formal Concept Analysis as a tool for formal
data analysis is its capability of producing graphical visualizations
of the inherent structures among data. Especially for social scientists,
who often handle data sets that cannot fully be captured in quantitative
analyses, Formal Concept Analysis extends the scientific toolbox of formal
analysis methods. Statistics and Concept Analysis complement each other
in this sense.
<P>
In the field of information science there is even a further application:
the mathematical lattices that are used in Formal Concept Analysis
are orderings and can therefore be interpreted as classification systems.
This leads to a new understanding of the structure of classification
systems which can be controlled by the formal representation.
This interpretation of classification structures is compatible with
theories among library scientists (such as Bliss and Shera).
Furthermore, Ranganathan's `facets' are represented as `scales'
in the framework of Formal Concept Analysis.
Formalized classification systems can be analysed according to the
consistency of their relations. Thesauri can automatically be constructed
from classes and their attributes, without having to create a hierarchy
of classes by hand. As an example, an on-line library catalog using the
Conceptual Diagrams of an automatically constructed class hierarchy has been
implemented in the ZIT library in Darmstadt.

<H1>Course Objectives</H1>

<OL>
<LI>

techniques, such as selection, grouping and scaling of features.

problems involved in the formalization of `informal' data.
<LI>

TOSCANA.
<LI> 
To provide practical experience with 
techniques of structuring graphical representations.
<LI>
To provide insights into the formal structure of classification systems.
</OL>

<H1>Class Organization</H1>

The course consists of lectures by the instructor and 
class discussions. About 50 % of the class time
will be spent in practical training (lab sessions and computer lab sessions). 
During the first session students will form teams of two to three
members. Each team will select a topic from a field of interest 
(this can be data they used for research in another class or research project)
which appears to be suitable to be analysed using Formal Concept Analysis.
The instructor will provide some topics for groups who do not find
an appropriate topic. The students will develop a formal analysis of their
data using the techniques they learn during the semester. In the 11th 
session the groups will present their results to the class.

<H4>Readings</H4>

Since the existing textbooks on Formal Concept Analysis are either written
for mathematicians or written in German, there will be no textbook for the 
class. All readings for the class will be put on reserve in the SLIS 
library. The students are required to make their own photocopies of
the two introductory papers (Wille (1996): `Introduction to FCA' and
Wolff (1994): `A first course in FCA') and bring them to class, since these
two papers will be used as the main material for several sessions. 
The readings should be read before the session to which they are assigned
according to the class schedule.

<H4>Grading</H4>

The final course grade will be computed for each student on the basis 
of grades assigned for the following:
<P><center>
<table BORDER=3>
<tr><td>
Class contribution <td> 1/3
<tr><td> Group Project <td> 1/3
<tr><td> Final Exam <td> 1/3
</table>
</center><P>
Each student is expected to complete all course work by the end of the term.
A grade of incomplete (I) will be assigned only if exceptional 
circumstances warrant.

<H4>Class contribution</H4>

Class contribution does not mean attendance, but the quality and quantity
of contributions to the work of the class. Comments and questions are
equally valuable if they help to clarify the topics
and to move the discussion forward. The assignments and readings
of each week must be completed before the class meeting so that
substantive and meaningful contributions from the students are possible.
It is required that every student demonstrate respect for the ideas,
opinions, and feelings of all other members of the class.

<H4>Group presentation and project</H4>

During the first session students will form teams of two to three
members. Each team will select a topic from a field of interest
which appears to be suitable to be analysed using Formal Concept Analysis.
The students will develop a formal analysis of their
data using the techniques they learn during the semester. In the 11th
session the groups will present their results to the class.
The class presentation will use several representation techniques 
learned during the semester and contain an interpretation of the results.
The presentation will last for 20 to 30 minutes.
The groups are recommended to
consult the instructor several times throughout the semester
to clarify questions and to discuss ways of solving problems.

<H4>Final Exam</H4>

The final exam will be a take-home exam consisting of two (small) data sets to 
be modeled with Formal Concept Analysis and two essay questions. 
It will be distributed during the 9th session and it will be due at the
beginning of the 12th session. Teamwork is not acceptable for the final 
exam.

<H4>Academic Dishonesty</H4>

Any assignment that contains plagiarized material or indicates any other
form of dishonesty will receive, at a minimum, an automatic grade of F.
A second instance will result in an automatic grade of F for the course.
