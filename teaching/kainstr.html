<h4>Instructions for Installation on private PC</h4>

Note: using your own PC is at your own risk. You cannot hold Napier
University responsible if your PC or any of your files get damaged
or deleted, etc.
<p>
If you are unsure about the installation instructions, ask the lecturer
for help before clicking on anything.
<p>
<li>Copy install_protege.exe onto your computer (you'll need 36 MB free
disk space). You may also copy toscanaj and conexp onto your computer
at the same time. Don't copy the Macintosh directory.
<li>Click on install_protege on your computer. If you have sufficient
disk space you may choose to install the full version, otherwise choose
the basic version. 
<li>After the installation, Protege should be in your Start Menu/Program
files.
<hr>
<h4>Instructions for Installation in JKCC</h4>

If you are unsure about the installation instructions, ask the lecturer
for help before clicking on anything. 
<p>
<li>Open a directory window (eg My Documents). Go to K:\Protege.
Click on install_protege. Choose either H:\Protege or H:\ as the
destination for your installation (you may need to create a Protege
folder first). If you have sufficient
disk space you may choose to install the full version, otherwise install
the basic version. 
<li>After the installation, goto the H:\Protege or H:\ and click on
"Protege jar executable file".
<hr>

<h4>Basic exercises using Protege</h4>

<li>Start Protege; choose the newspaper example.

<li>Have a look at the classes and find out which type of Advertisement
contains a slot called "image:.

<li>Using the slots hierarchy, find out what "image" refers to.

<li>Which slots does the class Columnist have that are not inherited
from Employee?

<li>How many instances of advertisements are there? Does any of the
instances actually have an image?

<li>Using the predefined queries, which people have a salary larger
than 100 000?
<p>
This will only work if the full version was installed:

<li>In the top menu, click on Project, then on Configure. Select
the TGVizTab.

<li>Select classes to add, then click on Create Graph. 

<h4>More advanced exercise</h4>

Create a new ontology:

<li>Select a topic that you are familiar with
and that is fairly simple. Examples: an ontology for the Simpson
family (from TV, see <a href="../i200/simpson.jpg">here</a> for
a diagram); or an ontology of pet animals, or ...

<li>Decide which classes, slots and instances you need. 

<li>Enter the information into Protege.

<h3>Practical 2</h3>

<h4>Instructions for Installation</h4>

Copy conexp-1.2.zip from the CD or from K:\Protege onto your harddrive
or H:\ drive. Unzip the file. Go into the conexp directory. To start
the program click on conexp.bat.

<hr>

<h4>Basic exercises using Conexp</h4>

Note: of all FCA software Conexp is probably easiest to use, but 
also has some limits. For example, if you accidentally click the
"open new file" button without first saving your current data, then your
data will be lost!
<br>
<br>

<li>Start Conexp
<li>Enter the context of the animals given in the handout of 
the lecture notes (Garfield, Socks, ...). It is probably best to 
first delete the objects and attributes that you 
don't need (by highlighting and right clicking).
<li>After you entered the data, its probably a good idea to save the file.
(Be careful NOT to click the "open new file" button at this point.)
<br>
<br>

<li>Click on Build lattice 
<li>Change the following drawing options:<br>
Attribs: Show labels, <br>
Objects: show labels, <br>
Draw node: fixed radius, <br>
Node radius: 8
<br>
<br>

<li>Click on "Start Attribute Exploration"
<li>Accept all questions except when it asks you whether all cartoon animals 
are mammals. Enter Donald Duck as a counter example. (Explanation: when it asks
you whether "dog, cat, mammal" implies "cartoon, real, tortoise" and so 
on, you need to click "accept" because no object can be dog and cat at the
same time. That means that the premise of this implication is empty and 
thus always true.)

<li>Click on "Context Editor" to see whether Donald has been added.
<li>Click on "Lattice Diagram". Click the checkbox on the right next to 
Donald (or click "Select all objects"). 
<li>Notice how the diagram has now changed. 
<br>
<br>

<li>Go back to the Context Editor and add a new object called "Daisy" and
give her the attributes "cartoon" and "tortoise". 
<li>Click on "Build lattice" and see if you can arrange the messy diagram
in a more readable fashion.
