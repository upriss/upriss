<H2>Introduction</H2>

Unix used to be the most popular and influential operating system
for large applications and multiple users.
Although it competes nowadays with Windows NT, which 
have Unix-like
multi-tasking and multi-user features, Unix is still widely used in academic
and research environments. This workshop will introduce some more advanced
Unix skills and concepts, such as the vi editor, shell scripting, and
basic system administration and security.
