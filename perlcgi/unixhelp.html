<h4>Running PHP etc on your PC or laptop</h4>

It is possible to install a webserver with PHP, Mysql, (and Perl) on your PC/laptop.
There are packages available, which are very easy to install and run (just
a single file to download). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WAMPs">
This page</a> provides an overview of such packages. One example is
<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a>. Because I don't use PCs,
I have not tested any of these packages and cannot guarantee that they will be
save to use.

<p>

If you happen to own a Linux or Mac OS X computer, you don't need to install
anything because these tools should be preinstalled. You just need to start
the webserver.

<h4>Some hints for working in a SSH window</h4>

<li>Editor: jpico (or pico or vi or nano).
<li>Use the arrow keys to repeat a previous command.
<li>Use the tab key to complete a filename.
<li>If the arrow keys or the tab key do not work, type
"setenv TERM vt100"  or "setenv TERM xterm". 
(You would have to do this once during every session.)
<li>In Pico, you can use Ctrl-K to delete/cut a line and Ctrl-U to 
get it back (paste). You can cut/uncut several adjacent lines in one go.

<h4>Connecting from a home computer to a remote webserver</h4>

A secure shell (SSH) client is needed. On Linux and Mac OS X, such a client
is usually preinstalled (type "ssh" at the command-line). For PCs there are several
clients freely available for download, such as
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>. Please,
note that using and installing PuTTY on your home computer is at your own risk.
Please, further note that
encryption software such as PuTTY may be illegal is some countries (but PuTTY
seems to be legally ok in the UK at the moment).
