<h4>1.1 Setting up PHP files on the server</h4>

A webserver must be PHP enabled for PHP scripts to run. The instructions 
below may have to be adapted to work on any particular webserver.

<p>
In general, you need two directories: "public_html" and a subdirectory
of "public_html" called "php". The public_html and the php directory should
both be world readable and executable. You may also need to change the permissions 
for your top level directory. The following commands create the 
directories and set the permissions in a typical Unix environment.
On Windows in a WAMP-like environment, the permissions are most likely automatically
set at the time of installation.
<p>
<font color=blue>
cd; chmod 711 .; <br>
mkdir public_html; chmod 755 public_html;<br>
cd public_html; mkdir php; chmod 755 php;
</font>
<p>


All html files should be in the public_html directory, all 
php files in the php directory. The php files should have an extension ".php".
The URL for the html files is<br>
<font color=blue>http://someserver/~username/filename.html</font>.
The URL for PHP files is<br>
<font color=blue>http://someserver/~username/php/filename.php
</font>

<h4>1.2 Exercises</h4>

1) Save some simple html code such as
<p>
<font color=blue>
&#60;html&#62;<br>
&#60;head&#62;&#60;title&#62;Hello World&#60;/title&#62;&#60;/head&#62;
&#60;body&#62;<BR>
&#60;h1&#62;Greetings&#60;/h1&#62;<BR>
&#60;/body&#62;&#60;/html&#62;<BR>
</font>
<p>
as a file in your public_html directory on the webserver.
(On Unix the file permissions of this file should be -rw-r--r--. Type
<font color=blue>ls -l</font> to check the file permissions.
You can set the permissions with <font color=blue>chmod 644 filename</font>.)
Now, look at the file through your browser.

<p>

2) Now save the same html file as above in your php directory under the
name greetings.php. 
(On Unix the file permissions should be -rwxr-xr-x. You can set the 
file permissions with <font color=blue>chmod 755 greetings.php</font>.)
Look at the file through your browser.

<h3>2 Processing forms with PHP</h3>

Normal HTML:
<p>
<table border=1>

<tr><td><b>browser</b><td><b>server</b>
<tr><td>user requests <br>
html document <td>
<tr><td><td> server finds HTML file <br>
 and sends page back
</table>
<p>
PHP:
<p>
<table border =1>
<tr><td><b>browser</b><td><b>server</b>
<tr><td>user requests  <br> a form <td>
<tr><td><td>      server finds the HTML form <br>
 and sends it back to user
<tr><td>user fills out form <td>
<tr><td><td>         PHP application executes<br>
 program and sends results<br>
 back to user
</table>

<h4>2.1 A sample form</h4>

<font color=blue>
&#60;form action="http://someserver/~username/php/example.php" 
method="get"&#62; <p>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="tea" checked &#62;   
Tea &#60;br&#62; <br>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="coffee" &#62; Coffee &#60;br&#62; 
<br>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="hot chocolate" &#62; Hot Chocolate
&#60;p&#62; <p>
&#60;input type="submit" value="Place order"&#62; <br>
&#60;/form&#62; <p>
</font>

<h4>2.2 Exercises</h4>

3) Include the form in an html document on the webserver (don't forget to 
change the URL of the form action so that it points to your 
php directory).

<h4>2.3 Source code of a form processing PHP file</h4>

<font color=blue>
&#60;html&#62;<br>
&#60;head&#62;&#60;title&#62; Tea is served&#60;/title&#62; 
&#60;/head&#62;&#60;body&#62;<br>
&#60;hr&#62;&#60;h1&#62; Tea Room&#60;/h1&#62;&#60;hr&#62;&#60;p&#62;<br>
&#60;?php<br>
if ($_REQUEST['drink'] != "tea" and $_REQUEST['drink'] != "coffee" and<br>
    $_REQUEST['drink'] != "hot chocolate") {<br>
  echo "An error occurred.";<br>
  exit;<br>
}<br>
if ($_REQUEST['drink']) {<br>
  echo "You requested ", $_REQUEST['drink'];<br>
}<br>
?&#62;<br>
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your visit. Please come again. &#60;p&#62;&#60;hr&#62;<br>
&#60;/body&#62;&#60;/html&#62;<br>
</font>
<p>
Note: in older or less secure installations of PHP, it is possible to
use a variable $drink instead of $_REQUEST['drink']. This is a very
insecure practise because in that way your script can't tell whether
$drink is an internal variable of the script or whether it comes
from a form. See the 
<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php">PHP manual</a>
for more information about register globals.

<h4>2.4 A PHP file that contains both the form and the reply</h4>

<font color=blue>
&#60;html&#62;<br>
&#60;head&#62;&#60;title&#62; Tea is served&#60;/title&#62; 
&#60;/head&#62;&#60;body&#62;<br>
&#60;hr&#62;&#60;h1&#62; Tea Room&#60;/h1&#62;&#60;hr&#62;&#60;p&#62;<br>
&#60;?php<br>
if ($_REQUEST['drink'] != "tea" and $_REQUEST['drink'] != "coffee" and<br>
    $_REQUEST['drink'] != "hot chocolate" and $_REQUEST['drink']) {<br>
  echo "An error occurred.";<br>
  exit;<br>
}<br>
if ($_REQUEST['drink']) {<br>
  echo "You requested ", $_REQUEST['drink'];<br>
}<br>
?&#62;<br>
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your visit. Please come again. &#60;p&#62;&#60;hr&#62;<br>
&#60;form action="example.php" method="get"&#62; <br>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="tea" checked &#62; Tea &#60;br&#62; <br>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="coffee" &#62; Coffee &#60;br&#62; <br>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="hot chocolate" &#62; 
Hot Chocolate &#60;p&#62; <br>
&#60;input type="submit" value="Place order"&#62; <br>
&#60;/form&#62;<br>
&#60;/body&#62;&#60;/html&#62;<br>
</font>

<h4>2.5 Exercises</h4>

4) Save the PHP  file, change permissions and 
check to see if it works via the browser and with the form from
the last exercise. Change the form action method from "get" to "post" 
and observe how this changes the query string.
<p>
5) Add a checkbox to the form (such as "Do you want milk? Yes/No")
and a text area where customers can type in what kind of cake they
would like to order.
Change your PHP script so that it includes these in its reply,
such as "you requested tea with milk", "sorry we are out of
chocolate cake". The checkbox and text area must have distinct
names in the form. 


<h3>3 On-line greeting cards</h3>

On-line greeting card services often involve several pages:
An HTML page lets a user select an image for the greeting card.
For example, the following HTML code, lets a user choose one out
of four images:
<p>
<font color=blue>
Select a picture:<br>
&#60;p&#62;<br>
&#60;A HREF="http://someserver/~username/php/greeting.php?image=1"&#62;<br>
&#60;img src="image1.jpg"&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;p&#62;<br>
&#60;A HREF="http://someserver/~username/php/greeting.php?image=2"&#62;<br>
&#60;img src="image2.jpg"&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;p&#62;<br>
&#60;A HREF="http://someserver/~username/php/greeting.php?image=3"&#62;<br>
&#60;img src="image3.jpg"&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;p&#62;<br>
&#60;A HREF="http://someserver/~username/php/greeting.php?image=4"&#62;<br>
&#60;img src="image4.jpg"&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;p&#62;
</font>
<p>
All four URLs link to the same PHP file ("greeting.php") which uses
a parameter ("image") to distinguish between the four images.
This PHP file should
produce a form with textboxes for the recipient's email address,
the recipient's name and the message.
<p>
Upon submitting this form a second PHP file is invoked, which sends
an email to the recipient. Because sending email from a form can be a security
risk, you should not attempt this before security has been discussed in the
lecture.

<h4>3.1 Exercises</h4>

6) For the greeting card example, write a PHP script that
prints "you have selected image ..." and the number of the
image selected. Then the PHP script prints textboxes for
the recipient's email address, the recipient's name and the message. 
<p>
7) The greeting card example shows that parameters can be added
to a URL (for example "greeting?image=3"). Try what happens
if you enter parameter values other than 1, 2, 3 or 4. 
Add an if statement to your PHP script that prints "not an acceptable
selection" if the image number is not 1, 2, 3 or 4.
