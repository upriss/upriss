&#60;p&#62; Here are the CGI environment variables that 
this PHP script has been called with<br>
&#60;p&#62;&#60;hr&#62;<br>
&#60;?php<br>
foreach($_SERVER as $key =&#62; $value) {<br>
  echo ($key . "=" . $value ."&#60;br&#62;");<br>
}<br>

<h4>1.1 Exercises</h4>

1) Try the script.
<p>
2) Use one of the PHP scripts that you have created earlier in this
semester and that responds to a form. Include a print statement in the PHP script that 
prints the environment variables REQUEST_METHOD, QUERY_STRING 
and CONTENT_LENGTH. Note: that some of these are only available if the
method for sending the form is "get", others are only available if the
method is "post". (Check the 
&#60;form action=... method=... &#62; tag in your form.)
REQUEST_METHOD and CONTENT_LENGTH can be used to 
increase the security of your script. CONTENT_LENGTH
should not be longer than a predefined maximum length. 

<h3>2 Customize Pages with PHP</h3>

PHP can show different pages to different users depending on user preferences.

<h4>2.1 Exercises</h4>

3) Ask a user to input their name into a textfield and 
to choose a color from a popup menu. Then display a page with
a short message (e.g. "Thank you $_REQUEST['name'] for your request") in that color.
