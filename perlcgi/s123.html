<h3>1 A first example "Hello World"</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# This program says "hello" to the world<br>
#<br>
print "Hello World!\n";<br>
</font>
<p>

Copy the blue text from the screen
and paste it into a file. Save the file, for example, under the
name "hello". Then type at the Unix prompt:

<font color=blue>
<p>
perl hello
<p>
</font>

<h4>1.1 Explanations</h4>

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td># </td><td>indicates a comment;  the line is ignored</td>
<tr><td>print </td><td> a command; prints the string between the quotes</td>
<tr><td>\n<td> newline character</td>
<tr><td>; </td><td> indicates the end of a command</td>
</table>

<h4>1.2 Exercises</h4>

* Add a second print statement to the script from the example.
(For example print "How are you?".)
What does adding or deleting "\n" change?

<h3>2 A second example </h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# A program for greeting people<br>
#<br>
print "What is your name? ";<br>
$name = &#60STDIN&gt ;<br>
chomp ($name);<br>
print "Hello, $name! How are you?\n";<br>
</font>

<h4>2.1 Explanations</h4>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>$name <td> a variable for a "name"
<tr><td> = <td> an assignment operator
<tr><td> &#60STDIN&#62  <td> reads from standard input (i.e. keyboard)
<tr><td> chomp <td> deletes the newline character ("enter" key)
</table>

<h4>2.2 Exercises</h4>

* What happens if you delete the line with "chomp"?
<br>
* Write a program that
asks two people for their names; stores the names in variables
called $name1 and $name2; says hello to both of them.

<h3>3 Operators for Numbers</h3>

<font color=blue>
$a = 3 -4 +10;<br>
$b = 5*6;<br>
$c = 7/8;<br>
print "These are the values: $a $b $c \n";<br>
print "Increment $a by one: ";<br>
$a++;<br>
print $a;<br>
print "\n";<br>
print "Decrease $a by one: ";<br>
$a--;<br>
print $a;<br>
print "\n";     
</font>      

<h4>3.1 Exercises</h4>

* Execute the script. Make sure you understand every line.

<h4>3.2 Example</h4>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
# <br>
# This program converts from US $ to Canadian $<br>
# <br>
print "Money value in US \$ ";<br>
$us_money = &#60;STDIN&#62; ;<br>
chomp $us_money;<br>
$can_money = $us_money /0.6;<br>
print "US\$ $us_money = Canadian \$ $can_money\n";<br>
</font>

<h4>3.3 Exercises</h4>

* In analogy to the example, write a script that 
asks users for the temperature in F
and prints the temperature in C. (Conversion: 
Celsius = (F - 32) * 5/9 )<br>

<h3>4 Strings</h3>

A string is delimited by double quotes (""). Certain special characters
can be used, such as "\n" and "\t". Variables are interpreted, i.e.
'print "$name"' prints the value of '$name' and not $-sign followed by
'name'. To print the characters $, ", \, @, they must be preceded
by a backslash (\). 
<p>
<font color=blue>
print "hello\n";<br>
print "hello\\n";<br>
print "\$5.00\n";<br>
print "She said: \"hello\"\n"; <br>
print "\tThis is indented\n"; <br>
$a = "apples"; $b = "pears"; <br>
print "$a and $b\n"; <br>
</font>

<h4>4.1 Exercises</h4>

* Write Perl print statements for 
the following text (with the same linebreaks, etc):
<p>
Snoopy bought a CD called "Greatest Hits" on the WWW for <br>
$10.00. To buy the CD he had to send an email message to <br>
orders@hits-online.net. This is what the design on the CD <br>
cover looked like:
<p>
<pre>
       \  |  /
         @ @
          *
        \---/
</pre>

<h4>4.2 Operators and functions for strings</h4>

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>chop $a; </td><td># removes the last character</td>
<tr><td>chomp $a; </td><td>
# removes the last character if it is a newline character</td>
<tr><td>$a = $b . $c; </td><td># concatenate $b and $c</td>
<tr><td>$a = $b x $c; </td><td># $b repeated $c times</td>
</table>

<h4>4.3 Example</h4>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w <br>
# <br>
# program that demonstrates operating with strings<br>
#<br>
print "Please, type your favorite color: ";<br>
$color= &#60;STDIN&#62;;<br>
chomp $color;<br>
$color = $color . "***";<br>
chop $color; chop $color;<br>
$color = $color . "!";<br>
$color = $color x 5;<br>
print "$color\n";
</font>
<p>
(If you are unsure what this program does,
add 'print "$color\n";' after every line so that you can see how
the content of the variable is changed at each step.) 

<h3>5 Logical expressions</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# if statement<br>
#<br>
print "Input first value:";<br>
$a = &#60STDIN&gt ;<br>
chomp $a;<br>
print "Input second value:";<br>
$b = &#60STDIN&gt ;<br>
chomp $b;<br>
if ($a and $b){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print "True\n";<br>
} else {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print "False\n";<br>
}
<p>
</font>

<h4>5.2 Exercises</h4>

* Write a script that asks someone to input their first name,
last name and phone number. If the user does not type at least
some characters for each of these, print "Do not leave any fields
empty" otherwise print "Thank you". (Hint: if a variable is empty,
its value will be "false".) <br>

<h4>5.3 Other logical expressions for if statements</h4>

<table border=1>
<tr><td>$a eq $b </td><td># Is $a equal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a ne $b </td><td># Is $a not equal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a == $b </td><td># Is $a numerically equal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a != $b </td><td># Is $a numerically unequal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a <= $b </td><td># Is $a smaller or equal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a >= $b </td><td># Is $a larger or equal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a < $b </td><td># Is $a smaller than $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a > $b </td><td># Is $a larger than $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a le $b </td><td># 
Does $a come before $b in the alphabet or is equal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a ge $b </td><td># 
Does $a come after $b in the alphabet or is equal to $b?</td>
<tr><td>$a lt $b </td><td># Does $a come before $b in the alphabet? </td>
<tr><td>$a gt $b </td><td># Does $a come after $b in the alphabet? </td>
</table>
<p>
Note: usually "eq" and "ne" work even for numbers. So, you can use them
instead of "==" and "!=".

<h4>5.4 Exercises</h4>

* Write a program that asks a user to input a color.
If the color is black or white, output "The color
was black or white". If it starts with a letter
that comes after "k" in the alphabet,
output "The color starts with a letter that comes after "k" in the 
alphabet". 

<h3>6 Control structures: if</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# if statement<br>
#<br>
print "Do you like Perl? ";<br>
$answer = &#60;STDIN&#62;;<br>
chomp $answer;<br>
if ($answer eq "yes"){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print "That is great!\n";<br>
} else {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print "That is disappointing!\n";<br>
}
</font>

<h4>6.1 Exercises</h4>

5) Modify the program so that it answers "That is great!" if the
answer was "yes", "That is disappointing"
if the answer was "no" and "That is not an answer to my question."
otherwise. Use "if ... elsif ... else ...". Note that "if" and
"elsif" are followed by an expression in parenthesis () and then
a statement in curly brackets {}, "else" is followed only by a statement
in curly brackets.

<h4>6.2 While</h4>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# while statement<br>
#<br>
$answer = "no";<br>
while ($answer ne "yes"){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;print "Do you like Perl? ";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;$answer = &#60STDIN&#62;;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;chomp $answer;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;if ($answer eq "yes") {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;print "That is great!\n"; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;} else {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "That is not the right answer! Try again.\n";
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>	
	}<br>	
</font>


<h4>6.3 Exercises</h4>

* Modify the program from above so that it asks users to "guess the lucky 
number". If the correct number is guessed the program stops,
otherwise it continues forever.

<h4>6.4 Using a counter</h4>

* Write a program that asks five times to guess the lucky number.
Use a while loop and a counter, such as
<p>
<font color=blue>
$counter = 1;<br>
while ($counter <= 5) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;print "Type in the $counter number\n";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;$counter++;<br>
}</font>
<p>
The program asks for five guesses (no matter whether the correct
number was guessed or not).
If the correct number is guessed, the program outputs
"Good guess!\n", otherwise it outputs "Try again!\n". 
After the fifth guess it stops and prints "Game over.\n".

<h4>6.5 Last</h4>

* In the previous example, insert "last;" after the "Good guess!\n"
print statement. "last" will terminate the while loop so that
users do not have to continue guessing after they found the number. 

<h3>7 Arrays</h3>

Arrays in Perl are lists. It should be noted that 
arrays in PHP correspond to hashs in Perl, which are
lists of index/value or key/value pairs. Hashs are also called 
"associative arrays", "maps", "lookup tables" or "dictionaries".

<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# animals in a zoo<br>
#<br>
@zoo=("monkey", "tiger", "eagle");<br>
print "The zoo has the following ".@zoo." animals: @zoo\n";<br>
print "Which animal would you like to add? ";<br>
$new_animal = &#60STDIN&gt ;<br>
chomp $new_animal;<br>
push(@zoo, $new_animal);<br>
$length = @zoo;<br>
print "The zoo now has the following $length animals: @zoo\n";<br>
print "The 3rd animal in the list is $zoo[2]\n";        
</font>

<h4>7.1 Array operators and functions</h4>

<table border =2>
<tr><td>@zoo = ("monkey", "tiger", "eagle");</td><td>defining an array</td>
<tr><td>push(@zoo,"parrot"); </td><td>add elements at end of array</td>
<tr><td>@zoo = ("zebra","lion", @zoo);</td><td>add elements at beginning</td>
<tr><td>$length = @zoo; </td><td> length of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$animal = $zoo[0]; </td><td> the first element of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$animal = $zoo[2]; </td><td> the third element of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$animal = $zoo[@zoo-1]; </td><td> the last element of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$lastelement = pop(@zoo); </td><td> remove last element from @zoo</td>
<tr><td>@other_zoo = reverse(@zoo); </td><td> new array with reverse order 
  </td>
<tr><td>@other_zoo = sort(@zoo); </td><td> new array in alphabetical order</td>

</table>

<h4>7.2 Exercises</h4>

* Create an array that contains the names of 5 students of this class.
(You don't need a loop to do that. Simply assign the 5 values.)
Print the array. Remove (pop) the last name from the array.
Print the array.
Ask a user to type in her/his name. Add (push) that name to the array.
Print the array.
Ask a user to input a number. Print the name that has that number as
index.
Add "John Smith" and "Mary Miller" at the beginning of the array.
Print the array.
Print the array in alphabetical and in reverse order.<p>

<h3>8 Foreach</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# if statement<br>
#<br>
@zoo = ("tiger", "elephant", "monkey");<br>
foreach $animal (@zoo){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $animal = "_".$animal."_";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; print "$animal";<br>
}<br>
print "\n";<br>
</font>

<h4>8.1  Exercises</h4>

* Create a second copy of the array in reverse order.
Add a second foreach loop that
prints the reverse copy.

<h3>9 Input from a file</h3>

Click <a href="alice.txt">here</a> and save the file in your 
current directory under the name "alice.txt".
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>
#<br>
# Program to read and print a file <br>
#<br>
open(ALICE, "alice.txt");<br>
@lines = &#60ALICE&gt ;<br>
close(ALICE);<br>
print @lines;<br>

</font>
<h4>9.1 File handling</h4>

<table border=2>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "alice.txt"); <br>
open(FILEHANDLE, "&#60;alice.txt"); </td><td> open for input </td>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "&#62;alice.txt"); </td><td> open for output </td>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "&#62;&#62;alice.txt"); 
  </td><td> open for appending </td>
<tr><td>print FILEHANDLE "Some text.\n"; </td><td> print to an open file </td>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "alice.txt") || die "cannot open file";
  </td><td> open file, print error message</td>
</table>

<h4>9.2 Exercises</h4>

* Modify the program so that
the lines are printed in reverse order. <p>
* Write a Perl script that copies one file to another file. 
Then change the script so that it appends one file to another file.<p>
