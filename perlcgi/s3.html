<h3>1 Arrays</h3>

Arrays in Perl are lists. It should be noted that 
arrays in PHP correspond to hashs in Perl (see number 4 below), which are
lists of index/value or key/value pairs. Hashs are also called 
"associative arrays", "maps", "lookup tables" or "dictionaries".

<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# animals in a zoo<br>
#<br>
@zoo=("monkey", "tiger", "eagle");<br>
print "The zoo has the following ".@zoo." animals: @zoo\n";<br>
print "Which animal would you like to add? ";<br>
$new_animal = &#60STDIN&gt ;<br>
chomp $new_animal;<br>
push(@zoo, $new_animal);<br>
$length = @zoo;<br>
print "The zoo now has the following $length animals: @zoo\n";<br>
print "The 3rd animal in the list is $zoo[2]\n";        
</font>

<h4>1.1 Array operators and functions</h4>

a) Important ones
<p>
<table border =2>
<tr><td>@zoo = ("monkey", "tiger", "eagle");</td><td>defining an array</td>
<tr><td>push(@zoo,"parrot"); </td><td>add elements at end of array</td>
<tr><td>@zoo = ("zebra","lion", @zoo);</td><td>add elements at beginning</td>
<tr><td>$length = @zoo; </td><td> length of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$animal = $zoo[0]; </td><td> the first element of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$animal = $zoo[2]; </td><td> the third element of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$animal = $zoo[@zoo-1]; </td><td> the last element of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>$lastelement = pop(@zoo); </td><td> remove last element from @zoo</td>
<tr><td>@other_zoo = reverse(@zoo); </td><td> new array with reverse order 
  </td>
<tr><td>@other_zoo = sort(@zoo); </td><td> new array in alphabetical order</td>

</table>
<p>
b) Optional ones
<p>
<table border =2>
<tr><td>@zoo = qw(monkey tiger eagle);<br>@numbers = (1 .. 5);
  </td><td>defining an array</td>
<tr><td>$number = $#zoo; </td><td> index of the last element</td>
<tr><td>$animal = $zoo[-1]; <br>
  $animal = $zoo[$#zoo]; </td><td> the last element of @zoo</td>
<tr><td>@zoo[0,1] = @zoo[1,0]; </td><td> swap the first two elements</td>
</table>

<h4>1.2 Exercises</h4>

1) Create an array that contains the names of 5 students of this class.
(You don't need a loop to do that. Simply assign the 5 values.)
Print the array. Remove (pop) the last name from the array.
Print the array.
Ask a user to type in her/his name. Add (push) that name to the array.
Print the array.
Ask a user to input a number. Print the name that has that number as
index.
Add "John Smith" and "Mary Miller" at the beginning of the array.
Print the array.
Print the array in alphabetical and in reverse order.<p>
2) (Optional Exercise) Add <br>
$"="!"; <br>
after the line that starts with "push" in the zoo program
. How does it change the output?

<h3>2 Foreach</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# if statement<br>
#<br>
@zoo = ("tiger", "elephant", "monkey");<br>
foreach $animal (@zoo){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $animal = "_".$animal."_";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; print "$animal";<br>
}<br>
print "\n";<br>
</font>

<h4>2.1  Exercises</h4>

3) Create a second copy of the array in reverse order.
Add a second foreach loop that
prints the reverse copy.
<p>
4) Use the array of student names from exercise 1.
Create a foreach loop that prints for each student
"hello $student, how are you?".

<h3>3 Input from a file</h3>

Click <a href="alice.txt">here</a> and save the file in your 
current directory under the name "alice.txt".
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>
#<br>
# Program to read and print a file <br>
#<br>
open(ALICE, "alice.txt");<br>
@lines = &#60ALICE&gt ;<br>
close(ALICE);<br>
print @lines;<br>

</font>
<h4>3.1 File handling</h4>

<table border=2>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "alice.txt"); <br>
open(FILEHANDLE, "&#60;alice.txt"); </td><td> open for input </td>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "&#62;alice.txt"); </td><td> open for output </td>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "&#62;&#62;alice.txt"); 
  </td><td> open for appending </td>
<tr><td>print FILEHANDLE "Some text.\n"; </td><td> print to an open file </td>
<tr><td>open(FILEHANDLE, "alice.txt") || die "cannot open file";
  </td><td> open file, print error message</td>
</table>

<h4>3.2 Exercises</h4>

5) Modify the program so that
the lines are printed in reverse order. <p>
6) Write a Perl script that copies one file to another file. 
Then change the script so that it appends one file to another file.<p>
7) Optional: Modify the program so that 
each line is printed with a line number at the beginning.
(Hint: use a foreach loop and a counter.)<p>
8) Optional: Print the lines with a # character
at the beginning. Hints: a) what does adding "chomp @lines" change?
b) Use the $" variable.
c) You need to escape "#" so that it is not interpreted as a comment.
d) There is a difference between 'print @lines' and 'print "@lines"'.
As usual, the double quotes cause Perl to interpret the variables,
such as the $" variable.

<h3>4 Optional: Hashs</h3>

Hashs are like arrays whose indices are arbitrary scalars or like
relational database tables with two columns (a "key" and a "value"
column).
<p>
<font color=blue>
# defining a hash<br>
%relatives =("Lisa" =&#62; "daughter", "Bart" =&#62; "son", "Marge" =&#62;
 "mother", "Homer" =&#62; "father", "Santa" =&#62; "dog");<br>      
<br>
# to print a single element: <br>
print "Lisa is a $relatives{Lisa}\n";<br>
<br>
# to print an entire hash it should be converted into an array<br>
@array = %relatives;<br>
print "@array\n"; <br>
</font>

<h4>4.1 Exercises</h4>

9) Create a second hash (such as "age") and print it.

<h3>5 Optional: Other means of input</h3>

Input from STDIN can also be read into an array. The user has 
to type Ctrl-D (the end-of-file character) to terminate the input.
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
# <br>
# input into an array from standard input<br>
#<br>
print "Type something ";<br>
@something = &#60STDIN&gt ;<br>
print "@something \n";<br>
<p>
</font>

Alternative method of reading a file. This method should be used
for files that are too large to be read into an array at once.
<p>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>
#<br>
# Program to read and print a file<br>
#<br>
open(ALICE, "alice.txt");<br>
while (&#60ALICE&gt){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print $_;<br>
}<br>
close(ALICE);  <br>               
<p>
</font>
