<h4>Common sense knowledge and language</h4>

Examples:
<ul>
<li>The police arrested the demonstrators because they feared violence.
<li>The police arrested the demonstrators because they advocated violence.
<li>They drank two cups of tea because they were warm. 
<li>They drank two cups of tea because they were cold. 
<li>The box is in the pen.
<li>The pen is in the box.
<li>Time flies like an arrow. 
<li>Fruit flies like an apple.
<li>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
<li>She saw the man in the park with a dog.
<li>She saw the man in the park with a statue.
<li>She saw the man in the park with a telescope.
</ul>

Language highlights and connects 
concepts and relationships that people know from their experiences.

<ul>
<li>He opened the ... with the ... and walked inside.
<li>He ... the door with the key and ... inside.
<li>... opened the door ... the key and walked ...
</ul>

These examples show that individual words are not so important for
understanding. A sentence evokes a mental image because people have
knowledge about the world. Language provides hints for constructing
mental images but does not provide a complete description of 
reality.
<p>
Therefore natural language understanding and processing requires
<b>common sense knowledge</b> and <b>context</b>.
<p>
What is "context"?
<p>
Can common sense knowledge and context be stored in a (formal) language?
<p>
If "yes", it can be stored in ontologies such as CYC.

<h4>CYC</h4>
<ul>
<li>concepts and assertions
<li>context and micro-theories (eg. theories of space, temporal reasoning)
<li>CYC-L (logical inferences)
</ul>

<h4>CYC's applications (as reported in 1995)</h4>

<ul>
<li>information retrieval (eg. detailed user model)
<li>(semi-automatically) linking heterogeneous information sources
(eg. interface between two different databases)
<li>processing structured data (eg identify inconsistencies in databases)
<li>assist in word processing (spell checking, grammar, vocabulary,
word and sentence completion)
<li>assist in speech recognition
<li>simulations (eg. in adventure games)
<li>image retrieval using image captions
<li>machine translation
</ul>
