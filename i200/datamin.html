<h3>Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</h3>

<b>Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)</b> and 
<b>data mining</b> attempt to extract useful information from
databases, heterogeneous data sources and 
<b>very large databases (VLDB)</b>.
<p>
To be distinguished from:
<ul>
<li><b>information retrieval</b>: search for known items
<li><b>data analysis</b>: usually just traditional statistics
<li>most <b>traditional statistics</b>: prove or disprove hypotheses;
calculate a fixed set of statistical indicators (such as mean, variance);
correlate a few variables; etc
<li><b>machine learning</b>: automated computer learning process,
usually based on a fixed, carefully constructed database
</ul>
Tasks:
<ul>
<li>identify new relationships and global patterns in the data
<li>identify hidden knowledge
<li>identify trends that can be used for prediction
<li>identify influential variables (main factors)
<li>classification or clustering of items into meaningful groups
<li>identify association rules, ie. attributes or factors that are 
associated with each other
</ul>

<h4>Association Rules</h4>

Example: "People who buy beer also buy newspapers."
<p>
This is not a logical "inference" because it is not true for all
people. It is only true for people <i>in general</i>.
<p>
Rule: beer -> newspapers<br>
Rule: X -> Y
<p>
<b>support</b>: number of people who buy X and Y / all people<p>
<b>confidence</b>: number of people who buy X and Y / 
number of people who buy X
<p>
For example: if out of 1000 people there are 2 people who buy beer
and these 2 also buy newspapers, then the support for 
beer->newspapers is low (0.2%) but the confidence is high (100%).<br>
On the other hand, if out of 1000 people 100 buy beer and newspapers
and another 500 buy beer but no newspapers, then the 
support for beer->newspaper is higher (10%) but the confidence is 
lower (20%).

<h4>Applications</h4>
<ul>
<li>human genome project and similar applications in bioinformatics
<li>economy, business intelligence
<li>pharmaceutical industry: search for new drugs
<li>global systems: eg environmental issues, weather data
<li>market analyses
</ul>

<h4>Major Challenge</h4>

It is fairly easy to disvover new information. The questions is 
which discovered rules, trends, factors are
<b>novel, interesting, plausible and 
understandable</b>.
