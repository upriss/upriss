<h3>Faceted Knowledge Organization</h3>

<h4>Properties of facets</h4>

<li>facets represent viewpoints or aspects
<li>facets are based on the insight that universal classification
schemes usually fail due to the cultural and social nature of 
classification
<li>facets are modules that can be combined
<li>each single facet is consistent and exhaustive; different
facets are independent of each other which means that changes
to one facet do not affect other facets; the knowledge
represented by a combination of facets can be incomplete and 
inconsistent

<h4>History of facets</h4>

<li>Ranganathan (1940's) invented "facets" to represent different aspects
in a library classification scheme. He suggested the main facets
"personality, matter, energy, space, time"
<li>Guttman (1950's) invented "facets" independently of Ranganathan as
a means of structuring sociological surveys
