<h3>Spatial and Temporal Information</h3>

<h4>Temporal interval relations; temporal logic</h4>

<li>state-based representations; actions as state changes; 
preconditions - body of an action - effect
<li>temporal annotation: actions are represented as
state changes that are annotated with temporal data such as
duration
<li>non state-based representation: for example, Allen's interval logic
which uses "time period" and "meet" as primitives and the basic relations
"equal", "before", "meets", "starts", "finishes", "during", "overlaps".


<h4>Spatial information</h4>

<li>raster data: pixel- or cell-based; cannot be scaled; 
can represent complex continuous features; examples:
gif files, jpeg files, bitmaps
<li>vector data: points and lines in a coordinated system; 
object-oriented; can be scaled; examples: CAD, Flash, VML
<li>attribute data: non-spatial attributes that apply to spatial 
information 

<li>geographic information systems: storage, analysis and retrieval
of spatial information
