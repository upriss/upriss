<h3>Cognitive Organization of Information: Scripts, 
Schemas, and Mental Models</h3>

<h4>The mental lexicon and information organization/access</h4>

<li>procedural knowledge (knowing "how") versus declarative 
knowledge (knowing "what");
procedural knowledge can be non-verbal

<li>semantic memory (topic, definitions, "textbook knowledge") 
versus episodic memory (experience, history, "expert knowledge"), 

<li>investigating the mental lexicon: observing malfunctions
(tip of the tongue phenomenon, slips), word association tests,
experiments, patients with brain damage (stroke patients, aphasia,
split-brain patients), MRI

<h4>Scripts and schemata</h4> 

<li>Bartlett (1932): "schema" is a structured knowledge area in the
long term memory

<li>Minsky (1974): "frames" are data structures for stereotyped
situations

<li>Rumelhart (1984): "schema" is a data structure for representing 
generic
concepts stored in memory; schemata provide a script for concepts;
they provide guidance for interpretation, comprehension, recognition,
perception, remembering and learning

<li>Schank (1975): "scripts" are performed sequences of actions; they
provide language free representations of meaning
<p>
Example: Schank's restaurant script
<p>
1)<em> actor</em> goes to <em>restaurant</em><br>
2)<em> actor</em> is seated<br>
3)<em> actor</em> orders <em>meal</em> from <em>waiter</em><br>
4)<em> waiter</em> brings <em>meal</em> to <em>actor</em><br>
5)<em> actor</em> eats <em>meal</em><br>
6)<em> actor</em> gives money to <em>waiter</em><br>
7)<em> actor</em> leaves <em>restaurant</em><br>
