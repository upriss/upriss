<h4>Search engines and Web directories</h4>

<h4>Finding Specifc Information</h4>

Find the <a href="bruce.txt">information agents</a> text, which we 
used last week, on the web. Search for it using the following
search engines and write down for each engine how many copies
of the text you can find. 
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
<a href="http://www.northernlight.com/">Northern Light</a>
<a href="http://www.hotbot.com/">Hotbot</a>
<A HREF="http://www.altavista.com/">AltaVista</A>

<h4>Using categories</h4>

1) Find categories in 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>
and 
<a href="http://dmoz.org/">Open Directory Project</a>
where "information agents" belong. Note that the categories are not
called "information agents" and that
Yahoo uses Google for its "Web Page Matches". For this exercise
only look at the categories not at the "Web Page Matches". 
<p>
2) Find an introduction to object-oriented programming that explains
it without using a specific programming language.
<br>
Try it first on a <A HREF="http://www.google.com/">Search engine (Google)</a>
and then in a <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Web directory (Yahoo)</a>.
Which is the appropriate Yahoo category? 
Try the same search in the <a href="http://dmoz.org/">Open Directory 
Project</a>.
<p>
3) Find a tutorial for "DOM" (meaning the "Document Object Model") in
<a href="http://dmoz.org/">Open Directory Project</a> and 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>.
Does Yahoo
have a category in which the DOM tutorial can be found? Compare 
Yahoo's "Web Page matches" (i.e. its use of Google) with searching on 
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> directly.

<h4>Document clustering</h4>

Type "DOM" into 
<a href="http://www.vivisimo.com">Vivisimo</a>. Can you get an idea
of what DOM is about by looking at the categories
(which are generated by "document clustering")?
Compare with 
<a href="http://www.northernlight.com/">Northern Light</a>.

<h4>Further search options</h4>

Try searches for your name (if you have some web pages other than
on php.indiana.edu)
or the name of someone you know (if you don't have pages yourself.
Note that pages on php.indiana.edu are often excluded from search engines
because of a setting on php.indiana.edu that does not permit spiders
or robots.) Try all the different search engines and directories
mentioned before. Which ones work best? Try different combinations
of the name, eg "firstname lastname" or "lastname firstname"
or putting the name in double quotes. Do these make a difference?
Try the different advanced search options on
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search/options">Yahoo</a> and
<a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">Google</a>.
Do they make a difference?

<h4>More Search Tips</h4>

Here is a <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/
TeachingLib/Guides/Internet/Strategies.html">site</a> that has more
search tips and examples.
