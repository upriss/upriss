<H3>Introduction</H3>

The basic structure of information representation in social and 
scientific applications is the topic of this course. Organization,
storage and retrieval of information are important challenges for the 
modern information society. This course introduces representational
structures and approaches from many disciplines: philosophical
theories of classification and categorization; psycho-linguistic
models of mental language processing; information access and 
representation on the World Wide Web; object-oriented design 
and relational databases; AI knowledge representation and
discovery. The multi-disciplinary approach of this course
demonstrates how concepts of information representation are shared 
amongst different disciplines and how they can be combined. The goal
of the course is to provide a broad but basic introduction to current 
information representation techniques and paradigms. Although some 
software tools will be used in the exercises, the students are
not expected to write computer programs for this course. Even
concepts such as object-oriented design will be explained independently
of an actual programming language.

<H3>Course Objective</H3>

To introduce the student to a broad range of information 
representation models drawn from the fields of information science,
computer science, semiotics, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and
artificial intelligence. 

<H3>Prerequisites</h3>

Knowledge of a programming language as can be obtained from INFO I110, 
INFO I210, or similar courses. Recommended prerequisite or 
concurrent: INFO I201. Basic knowledge of how to use the WWW.

<H3>Class Organization</H3>

Each class session consists of lectures,
class discussions, and in-class exercises, which the students will
work on in small teams. Besides the in-class
exercises, assignments are given for each week that the students are
expected to  complete (with the help of the assigned readings) before the
weekly meetings. The assignments will be discussed in class.
The students will work on a semester-long team project that they 
will present during the last class session.

<H3>Readings</H3>

A readings package will be available from the IU bookstore.
Some of the readings are not included in the readings package but
instead are on-line linked to this syllabus. 
To read the on-line ACM readings, students
must use a computer that belongs to the indiana.edu domain because the
ACM digital library may not be available otherwise. 

<H3>Grading</H3>

The final course grade will be computed for each student on the basis 
of grades assigned for the following:
<P>
<table BORDER=3> <P ALIGN=CENTER>
<tr><td> Class contribution and listserv discussion<td> 1/3
<tr><td> Team project <td> 1/3
<tr><td> Midterm exam and multiple choice tests <td> 1/3
</table>

<P>
Each student is expected to complete all course work by the end of the term.
A grade of incomplete (I) will be assigned only if exceptional 
circumstances warrant. In all other cases there will be a grade 
penalty for items that are handed in late.

<H3>Class contribution</h3>

Class contribution 
includes the quality and quantity of contributions to the work of the
class.  The students are expected to complete the assignments and readings
of each week before the class meeting (except for the first week).
If a student misses a class, he/she will hand in that week's assignment,
which will not be graded but will ensure that the student does not
fall behind in the class.
Participation in the discussion of assignments and readings will 
be a large proportion of the class participation grade.
It is required that every student demonstrates respect for the ideas,
opinions, and feelings of all other members of the class.

<p>

A majordomo mailing list will be used to communicate about course
matters. The students should send comments and questions concerning the
reading materials and the assignments to this list. Students are expected to
post a minimum of on average one message per week.
The mailing list is <B>upriss_i200@indiana.edu</B>.

<H3><an href="classproj.html">Team Project</an></H3>

The students will work on a semester-long team project. Each team
will design an information system for the materials covered in this
class. The system can be web-based or use a more traditional paper-based
format. Each system must design three different means of information
representation or access, such as classification system, graphical
representation, database, metadata, ontology or others, as discussed
in this class. The information to be represented consists of the topics
and readings discussed in this class. Each information system must be
well documented and will be handed in during the last class meeting.
Each team will present their system during the last class meeting.

<H3>Midterm exam and multiple choice tests</H3>

The exam will be a take-home exam. Three multiple choice tests
will be handed out during the semester. They will be announced in
advance on the class mailing list.

<H3>A note on plagiarism</H3>

The students must clearly indicate if they use materials from
other sources, such as textbooks or Internet webpages. Full citation
information must be given for such sources. 
Academic and personal misconduct by students in this class are defined
and dealt with according to the
procedures in the <I>Code of Student Ethics</I>.
