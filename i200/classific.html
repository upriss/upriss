<h3>What is categorization or classification? </h3>

<h4>Classification</h4>

<li><em>Classification</em>: a partitioning (grouping) of items into 
classes with fixed, rigid boundaries. 
<li>Classes are defined by <em>necessary and sufficient features</em>;
"necessary" means that the features apply to all items in a class;
"sufficient" means that enough features are provided to distinguish
the class from other classes.
<li><em>Classification scheme</em>: a hierarchy of classes.
A class is a <em>subclass</em> of another class (superclass) 
if all the items of the subclass also belong to the superclass.
The classes at the lower levels of the hierarchy are <em>specialized</em>
or <em>concrete</em>; the classes at the higher levels are 
<em>general</em> or  <em>abstract</em>.
<li>Classes are <em>mutually exclusive</em>, which means that an item
cannot belong to more than one class on each level of a classification
scheme.

<h4>Examples of classification schemes</h4>

library classification schemes; biological taxonomies; directories
on the WWW; linguistic thesauri; philosophical classification 
schemes

<h4>Categorization</h4>

<li><em>Categories</em> are loose groupings of items; they are less
rigid than classes. 
<li>They are <em>non-exclusive</em>, which means
that an item can belong to many categories at the same time.  
<li>The boundaries among categories are not fixed, which means that 
it is sometimes not clear whether an item belongs to a category
or not. 
<li>Categories usually have some <em>prototypical members</em> that
are at the conceptual "center" of a category. The membership is
<em>graded</em>, which means some items are "better" members of
categories than others.
<li>There may not be features that are shared by all members of a 
category, but members of a category usually show some <em>similarity</em>
to each other.

<h3>The cultural and cognitive nature of classification and 
categorization </h3>

Classification and categorization usually
depend on a social, linguistic and cultural context. It is therefore
very difficult (or impossible) to build "universal" schemes that
cover all human knowledge.
<p>
Examples: Labov's cups; Berlin & Kay's basic color terms;
prototypical class/category members, such as robin, pigeon for "bird";
chair, table for "furniture"


<h3>Philosophical theories of classification and concepts </h3>

Philosophical theories of classification: Aristotle; Smith & Medin.<br>
Rosch's "Prototype Theory" for categories.
