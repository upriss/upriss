<h4>Running PHP etc on your PC or laptop</h4>

It is possible to install a webserver with PHP, Mysql, (and Perl) on your PC/laptop.
There are packages available, which are very easy to install and run (just
a single file to download). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WAMPs">
This page</a> provides an overview of such packages. One example is
<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a>. Because I don't use PCs,
I have not tested any of these packages and cannot guarantee that they will be
save to use.

<p>

If you happen to own a Linux or Mac OS X computer, you don't need to install
anything because these tools should be preinstalled. You just need to start
the webserver.

<p>

You are allowed to use your laptop for the coursework demonstration.


<h4>Using your i-drive</h4>

<li>You can edit the files on the I:-drive using Notepad or WordPad
because the I:-drive provides
access to the same files as the telnet window. You will still have 
to execute Perl in the SSH window. If you do not have an I:-drive,
you need to map it: Go to All Programs -> School of Computing ->
Unix -> Map Unix drives.
<li>You can save your files to a floppy or to another drive via the I:-drive.

<h4>Some hints for working in the SSH window</h4>

<li><b>Editor:</b> jpico (or pico or vi).
<li>Use the arrow keys to repeat a previous command.
<li>Use the tab key to complete a filename.
<li>In jpico, you can use Ctrl-K to delete/cut a line and Ctrl-U to 
get it back (paste). You can cut/uncut several adjacent lines in one go.

<h4>Connecting from a home computer</h4>

A secure shell (SSH) client is needed. On Linux and Mac OS X, such a client 
is usually preinstalled (type "ssh" at the command-line). For PCs there are several
clients freely available for download, such as 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>. Please,
note that using and installing PuTTY on your home computer is at your own risk.
Please, further note that
encryption software such as PuTTY may be illegal is some countries (but PuTTY
seems to be legally ok in the UK at the moment). The address for the
server is <font color=red>socweb3.napier.ac.uk</font>.
