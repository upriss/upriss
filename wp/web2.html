<h3>Evaluating websites</h3>


Work as a team of 2-3 students. Select 3 websites which you would like
to evaluate (for example, the Ostfalia website and some websites
some of you have developed). Record your results in a table. 
At the end of this exercise three teams will be asked to present their results
to the class.

<p>

1) Check your 3 websites with the W3C tools. (Evaluate the usefulness of these
tools as well: which tools are particularly useful?)

<ul>
<li><a href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a>
<li><a href="http://validator.w3.org/mobile/">http://validator.w3.org/mobile/</a>
<li><a href="http://validator.w3.org/checklink">http://validator.w3.org/checklink</a>
<li><a href="http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/">http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/">http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/</a>
</ul>

<p>

2) Evaluate the usability of your 3 websites. (If you have already taken
an HCI class, you can use anything you remember from that class for
this task.) Evaluate with respect to:

<ul>
<li>content 
<li>navigation
<li>aesthetics and design 
<li>metaphors
<li>components (does it have a search, sitemap, "about", help, etc)
<li>what do you like/not like about the site and why
</ul>

<p>

3) Check the accessibility of your website:
<p>
Find a suitable tool on this website:
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/tools/complete">W3C accessibility checking tools</a>
<p>
Try this <a href="http://www.clickability.co.uk/lynx-viewer.php">lynx viewer</a>
to get an idea how the page is structured to someone using a text-based
browser.

<h3>Non-teamwork exercises:</h3>

<h4>Tools for content development</h4>

Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlzTQ86jB_c">this short video</a>
about Typo3 (as an example of a CMS).

<p>

Here is a video of a WAF:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ISUy1VUDQ">Ruby on Rails</a>

<p>

Do you understand the difference between CMS and WAF and what they are
used for? Would either a CMS or a WAF have been useful for any of the websites
you have developed/might develop? Have you used a CMS or WAF before?

<h4>Other tools</h4>

If you are using Firefox and have not already done so, 
consider installing Firebug and have a look at its features for analysing
websites.
