<h3>5.3 Exercise: Software consulting firm</h3>
A software consulting firm wishes to keep the following data for an employee
and costing database:
<ul>
<li>employee number </li>
<li>employee name </li>
<li>employee address </li>
<li>salary </li>
<li>current job code </li>
<li>job history (job promotion code + year) </li>
<li>office location </li>
<li>telephone number </li>
<li>project number </li>
<li>project name </li>
<li>task number </li>
<li>task name </li>
<li>project budget </li>
<li>task expenditure to date </li>
<li>department number </li>
<li>department name</li>
</ul>
There are none, one or more job promotion code/year entries per employee.
The office location uniquely depends on the telephone number, and there may
be more than one employee using the same telephone and more than one telephone
in the one office. Tasks are numbered uniquely only within each project.
An employee may be concurrently assigned to more than one project and
task, but belongs to one department. Reduce this data to third normal form.
