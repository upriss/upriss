<h3>1.5 Summary: 3NF</h3>
<ul>
<li> A relation is in 3NF if it contains no repeating groups, no partial 
functional dependencies, and no transitive functional dependencies.
<li> To convert a relation with transitive functional dependencies to 3NF, 
remove the attributes involved in the transitive dependency and put them 
in a new relation.
<li> Rule: A relation in 2NF with only one non-key attribute must be in 3NF
<li> In a normalised relation a non-key field must provide a fact about the 
key, the whole key and nothing but the key.
<li> Relations in 3NF are sufficient for most practical database design 
problems. However, 3NF does not guarantee that all anomalies have been removed.
