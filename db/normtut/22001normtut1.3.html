<h3>1.3 Summary: 2NF</h3>
<ul>
<li> A relation is in 2NF if it contains no repeating groups and no 
partial key functional dependencies
<li> Rule: A relation in 1NF with a single key field must be in 2NF
<li> To convert a relation with partial functional dependencies to 2NF, 
create a set of new relations:
<ul>
<li> One relation for the attributes that are fully dependent upon the key.
<li> One relation for each part of the key that has partially dependent attributes
</ul>
</ul>
