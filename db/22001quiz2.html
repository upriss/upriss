Revision Questions for Week 3 and 4. The answers will
be posted on WebCT later in the semester.

<h4>Which of the following is NOT an ER diagram connection trap?</h4>

<li>Fan trap
<li>Mousetrap
<li>Chasm trap

<h4>Fan traps</h4>

A many-to-one relationship between Ingredients and Meals and a
many-to-one relationship between Dishes and Meals constitutes
a possible fan trap because the pathway between  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
and _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is ambiguous. 
<p>
The fan trap can be resolved by changing the many-to-one relationship
between _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  and _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  into a
many-to-one relationship between _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  and _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .

<h4>A Chasm trap can occur if ... (choose one)</h4>

<li>all relationships are mandatory
<li>some relationships are optional

<h4>Which of the following is NOT part of Enhanced ER Models (EER)?</h4>

<li>generalisation
<li>categorisation
<li>normalisation
<li>specialisation
<li>aggregation

<h4>Which of the following is a relationship, relationship type or relation?</h4>

<li>Bus-Driver
<li>Bus 14 - Driver John Smith
<li>The database table that holds the data about buses and drivers.

<h4>Which of the following is NOT true?</h4>

<li>1:1 relationships that are mandatory at both ends can be
mapped into a relation by either combining or not combining the tables. 
<li>1:1 relationships that are optional at one end are mapped
into a relation by taking the primary key from the 'mandatory end'
and adding it to the 'optional end' as a foreign key. 
<li>1:1 relationships that are optional at both ends must
be kept in 2 tables.
<li>1:m relationships are mapped by taking the primary key from the
'many end' and adding it to the 'one end' as a foreign key.
<li>M:n relationships are mapped by creating a new relation that
contains the keys from both sides.

<h4>Which of the following may include rows that failed the JOIN

<table border=1>
<tr><td>"depno BETWEEN 3 AND 5" </td><td> "depno > 2 AND depno < 6"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"depno IN (1,2,3)" </td><td> "depno = 1 OR depno =2
OR depno =3" </td></tr>
<tr><td>"depno > ANY (1,2,3)" </td><td> "depno = 1 AND depno =2
AND depno =3" </td></tr>
<tr><td>"depno > ANY (SELECT depno FROM department)" 
</td><td> "depno > (SELECT MIN(depno) FROM department)"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"depno >= ALL (SELECT depno FROM department)" 
</td><td> "depno >= (SELECT MAX(depno) FROM department)"</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Which of the following is correct?</h4>
