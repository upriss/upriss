<p><hr><p><h3>1.1 Creating object types and object-relational tables</h3>
A <b>relational table</b> for "people" can be created with the 
following statement:
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   CREATE TABLE people (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      name        VARCHAR2(30),<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      phone       VARCHAR2(20) );<br>
</font>
<p>An object-relational table for the same data is created in 
two steps. First, an <b>object type</b> is defined. We call
this type "person" to distinguish it from the object-relational
table "people". (The slash "/" is needed only in SQLPLUS
to indicate the end of the type declaration.)
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   CREATE TYPE person AS OBJECT (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      name        VARCHAR2(30),<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      phone       VARCHAR2(20) );<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   /<br>
</font>
<p>In a second step, an <b>object table</b> is created, which will hold
the actual data (or objects).
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   CREATE TABLE person_table OF person;<br>
</font>
<p><b>Exercises:</b>
<p><font color=red>It may be a good idea if you save some of the SQL
statements that you develop in the exercises in a text file
on your workstation (by copying into a Wordpad or Notepad file). 
Tables, such as person_table, will be
used in several exercises. You may be asked to make changes to
these tables later. </font>
<p><ul>
<li> 1. Execute these three statements in SQLPLUS.
</ul>
<p><ul>
<li> 2. Look at the catalog ("Select * from cat") and at the
description of the tables and the object type ("describe ...").
</ul>
<p><p><hr><p><h3>1.2 Inserting Values</h3>
Object tables 
can be used both in a relational manner but also in
an object-relational manner.
<p>Inserting values into an object table
in a relational manner (two values are inserted):
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   INSERT INTO person_table VALUES (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      'John Smith',<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      '1-800-555-1212' );<br>
</font>
<p>Inserting values in an object-relational manner (one value is 
inserted, but this one value is an object of type "person", which
has itself two values):
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   INSERT INTO person_table VALUES (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      person ('Mary Smith',<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      '1-800-555-1212') <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   );<br>
</font>
<p><font color=red>If types are nested, i.e., one type is used 
to create another type, then the object-relational insertion
must be used for the nested types!</font>
<p><b>Exercises:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> 3. Insert five rows into "people" and into "person_table". For 
the object table "person_table" try both methods of insertion.
</ul>
<p><ul>
<li> 4. Create a type "job" with four columns: "jobtitle" of datatype
VARCHAR(20) and "job_ID", 
"salary_amount" and "years_of_experience" of datataype INT. 
Create an object table "job_table" for this type.
Insert 5 rows into this table.
</ul>
<p><p><hr><p><h3>1.3 Select statements</h3>
There are also two methods for selecting from an object table.
<p>In a relational selection, two columns are selected. The use of 
aliases ("p" in this case) is not required but possible.
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   SELECT p.name, p.phone FROM person_table p <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      WHERE p.name = 'John Smith';<br>
</font>
<p>In an object-relational selection, one column is selected. The 
VALUE() function retrieves objects and their values.
In this case the use of an alias ("p") is required.
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   SELECT VALUE(p) FROM person_table p<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
       WHERE p.name = 'John Smith';<br>
</font>
<p><b>Exercises:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> 5. Try different select statements on both tables, such as
"SELECT * FROM ...", "SELECT name FROM ...",
"SELECT p.name FROM ...", "SELECT VALUE(p) FROM ...".
</ul>
<p><p><hr><p><h3>1.4 Object types as user-defined datatypes</h3>
In a previous section, it was described how object tables can be
created that correspond to object types. In these tables each row
represents one object (<b>row objects</b>). It is also possible to 
use object types as user-defined datatypes similar to how the
predefined Oracle data-types are used. That means that objects 
can occupy table columns or can serve as attributes for other objects.
These are called <b>column objects</b> and are described in this section.
<p>For example, in a relational table, address information could
look like this: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (street, number, city, postal_code)<br>
 But this
does not express the fact that street and number are more
closely related than street and city. In an object
table, the same information can be stored as<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ((street, number), city, postale_code)
<p>The following code shows how this is done. Note that this is the same
kind of CREATE TYPE definition as used for "person". But this time
there is no "street_table" created. Instead "street" is used as a
datatype in "address".
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   CREATE TYPE street AS OBJECT (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      sname       VARCHAR2(30),<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      snumber     NUMBER );<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   /<br>
</font>
<p><font color=blue>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   CREATE TYPE address AS OBJECT (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      street_and_number   street,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      city                VARCHAR2(30),<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
      postal_code         VARCHAR2(8));<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   /<br>
</font>
<p><b>Exercises:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> 6. Create an object type "address" that contains street name, number,
flat number, city, postal code, and country in a manner so that street name,
number and flat number are closely related and country is separate from
all the other attributes.
</ul>
<p><p><hr><p><h3>1.5 Dropping types and tables</h3>
Object types and object tables can be dropped and deleted in the usual manner
("DROP TABLE ...", "DROP TYPE ...")
but a type or table cannot be dropped while some other type or
table depends on it. Anything that depends on table X must be dropped
before table X can be dropped.
<p><b>Exercises:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> 7. Drop "person" and "person_table".
</ul>
<p><ul>
<li> 8. Create a type "person" which contains first name, middle initial,
last name, phone (business, home, mobile) and address (from exercise 6). 
Make sure that
first name, middle initial, last name are closely related and that the phone
numbers are closely related to each other.
</ul>
<p><p><ul>
<li> 9. Create an object table "person_table" that corresponds to "person".
</ul>
<p><ul>
<li> 10. Insert five rows of data into "person". (Note: you'll have to 
use the object-relational form of insertion.)
</ul>
