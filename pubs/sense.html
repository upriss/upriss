<p>
We invite papers on the application of conceptual structures (such as
<a href="http://www.upriss.org.uk/fca/fca.html">Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)</a> or 
<a href="http://conceptualstructures.org/">Conceptual Graphs</a>)
to the extraction of semantics from natural language resources (corpora,
the Web, thesauri or lexical databases). Conceptual structures provide mathematical
models for concepts, semantic relations and hierarchies. Their usefulness
for the extraction and modelling of semantics has been explored in prior research, 
but there have
been very few conferences or workshops specifically dedicated to linguistic
aspects of conceptual structures. This workshop intends to provide an 
interdisciplinary 
forum for conceptual structures applications that focus on modelling, extracting,
representing, analysing and exploring natural language semantics.
