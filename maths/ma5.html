<h3>Preparation</h3>

As a preparation for todays exercises, save the following code in a file
called <font color=blue>write_gif.py</font> in your current directory.
(You don't need to read and understand this code. It is just a utility
for saving graphs into gif files.)

<font color=blue><pre>
import networkx
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from networkx.utils import _get_fh

def write_gif(G, path, prgr="dot"):
    """
    Write the graph G in gif format using Graphviz
    """

    pathgif = path + ".gif"
    pathdot = path + ".dot"

    fh=_get_fh(pathdot,mode='w')        

    count=iter(range(G.number_of_nodes()))
    node_id={}

    if G.is_directed():
        fh.write("digraph G{node [ ];\n")
    else :
        fh.write("graph G{node [ ];\n")
    for n in G:
        nid=G.node[n].get('id',count.next())
        node_id[n]=nid
        fh.write("%s ["%nid)
        fh.write("label = \"%s\"];\n"%n)
    for u,v,edgedata in G.edges_iter(data=True):
        if G.is_directed():
           fh.write("%s ->"%node_id[u])
        else:
           fh.write("%s --"%node_id[u])
        fh.write("%s\n"%node_id[v])
    fh.write("}\n")
    cmd = prgr + ' -Tgif -o ' + pathgif + ' ' + pathdot
    pipe = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdin=PIPE).stdin
</pre>

<h3>1 Graphs</h3>

<h4>1.1 Exercise</h4>

1) Which of the following graphs are isomorphic (i.e. they are the same
but their layout is different)?
<p>
<table>
<tr><td>1:<br> <img src='mfig1.gif' height=250>
<td>2:<br> <img src='mfig5.gif' height=220>
<td>3:<br> <img src='mfig2.gif' height=350>
<tr><td>4:<br> <img src='mfig3.gif' height=250>
<td>5:<br> <img src='mfig4.gif' height=220>
<td>6:<br> <img src='mfig6.gif' height=250>
</table>
<p>
It can be easier to determine that two graphs are not isomorphic than
to show that they are. Which property of the nodes can be used to
determine that two graphs are not isomorphic?


<h4>1.2 Creating graphs with NetworkX</h4>

In order to use the graph modules, the following is needed:

<font color=blue><pre>
from networkx import *
from write_gif import *
</pre></font>

Commands for creating a graph and adding nodes and edges:

<font color=blue><pre>
G=Graph()                           ### initialises a new graph
G.add_node("One")
G.add_nodes_from(["Hello","World"]) ### adding a list of nodes
G.add_edge("Hello","World")
G.add_edges_from([("One","Hello"),("One","World")])
H= DiGraph(G)                       ### creates a directed graph using G
</pre></font>

Commands for displaying nodes and edges:

<font color=blue><pre>
G.nodes()
G.edges()
</pre></font>

Removing edges:

<font color=blue><pre>
G.clear()
</pre></font>


<h4>1.3 Exercise</h4>

2) Create Graph 1 from exercise 1).

<h4>1.4 Viewing graphs</h4>

The following command creates a gif file of a graph G:

<font color=blue><pre>
write_gif(G,"filename")
</pre></font>

Instead of <font color =blue>filename</font> 
you should type a name of a file (without extension). After executing
the command, two files, <font color =blue>filename.gif</font> and  
<font color =blue>filename.dot</font> (which can be ignored), will appear in the current
directory. You can view the gif file via your I:-drive. 
<p>

The software that creates the layouts is called Graphviz. These
layout options are available:
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>write_gif(G,"filename")<td>hierarchical layout
<tr><td>write_gif(G,"filename","neato")<td>spring model layout
<tr><td>write_gif(G,"filename","fdp")<td>another spring model layout
<tr><td>write_gif(G,"filename","twopi")<td>radial layout
<tr><td>write_gif(G,"filename","circo")<td>circular layout
</table>
<p>
This <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">website</a> has more
information about Graphviz and the different types of layouts.
<p>
(<a href="writegif.html">Here</a> is more information on how to use Graphviz 
with NetworkX.)

<h4>1.5 Exercises</h4>

3) Try different layouts for the graph you created in exercise 2.
<p>
4) NetworkX provides many standard graphs. Try different layouts for these:

<font color=blue><pre>
G1=house_x_graph()
G2=complete_bipartite_graph(3,5)
G3=lollipop_graph(10,20)
</pre></font>

Where did you see the House Graph in the lecture?

<h4>1.6 Exercises: other graph operations </h4>

5) NetworkX provides many graph operations. Using the graphs G (from
exercise 2) and G1, G2, G3 from exercise 4 determine the following:

<ul>
<li>Which of the graphs are bipartite (using <font color=blue>is_bipartite(G)</font>?
<li>Generate the complement of G1 (using <font color=blue>complement(G1)</font>. 
Look at the gif files for G1 and its
complement. Can you figure out what is meant by "complement" here?
<li>Calculate the <font color=blue>diameter(G)</font> and the 
<font color=blue>radius(G)</font> of the graphs.
The diameter is the maximum distance (shortest path) between two nodes in the graph;  
the radius is the minimum steps needed to reach all nodes from a
single node.
How much larger can the diameter be compared to the radius?
Can you use these values to determine which of the graphs have
a small-world effect with "six degrees of separation"?
</ul>

<h4>1.7 Exercises with pen and paper</h4>

Using the graphs from exercise 1 and G1, G2, G3 from exercise 4
determine the following:

<p>
6) Determine the chromatic number of the graphs.
(The chromatic number is the minimum number of colours needed to colour a
graph so that neighbouring nodes have different colours.)
<p>

7) Which of the graphs have a Hamiltonian or Eulerian path?
