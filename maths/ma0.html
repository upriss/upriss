<h4>Configuring your SSH client (Putty)</h4>

<ul>
<li> Under "Window - Translation" set the value for
"Received data assumed to be in which character set" to UTF-8
<li> Under "Session", enter the host name: &nbsp;
socweb8.napier.ac.uk
<li> Save this session: type a name in the field "Saved sessions",
then click "Save"
<li> Click "Open"
</ul>
<p>
You can configure the client when it starts up or for the current
session (in which case you need to click on the icon in the top left corner).
<p>
The next time you start the client, click on your saved session 
and then "Open".

<h4>Using Python on the Unix server</h4>

Type <font color="blue">python</font> at the command line.
This starts the interactive mode. You can now type commands. To
leave the interactive mode press the control key followed by
<font color="blue">D</font>. 
<p>
In order to use sympy and to set python to accept certain
conventions, you should copy and paste the following code
after you start python. (Use the right mouse button for pasting.)

<font color=blue><pre>
from __future__ import division
import sys
from sympy import *
sys.displayhook = pprint
</pre></font>

You need to do this whenever you start python.

<h4>Save the Python settings permanently</h4>

Type <font color=blue>nano .pythonstartup</font> to create a file.
Save the following lines to that file:

<font color=blue><pre>
from __future__ import division
import sys
from sympy import *
sys.displayhook = pprint
</pre></font>

Next, determine which shell you are using by typing
<font color=blue>printenv SHELL</font>. Please be careful with the next
steps. If you don't understand this, please ask for help. If you mess up your
login file, you will not be able to login to your account anymore.
<p>

If you are using bash, type <font color=blue>nano .profile</font> 
and add this line to the end of the file:

<font color=blue><pre>
export PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pythonstartup
</pre></font>

Save the file and type <font color=blue>source .profile</font> to
apply the changes.

<p>
(If you were using a c-shell, you would need to add this line to your .cshrc file:
<font color=blue>setenv PYTHONSTARTUP ~/.pythonstartup</font>)
