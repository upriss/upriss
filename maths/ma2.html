<h3>1 Python scripts</h3>

For longer programs it is sometimes more convenient to write
a script instead of using the interactive interpreter.
<p>
To edit code, it is easiest to open two windows. Edit
the code in one window and execute it in another window. On Socweb:
after mapping your I-drive, you can open/edit/save your files on the
I-drive. Use Notepad++ or UltraEdit for editing. (Don't use Notepad
because copy and paste might create invisible control characters.)
Then open the ssh window and use it for executing your code. In the
ssh window, use uparrow to repeat the previous command.
<p>

<font color=blue><pre>
# This program adds and multiplies two numbers

number1 = input("Input the first number ")
number2 = input("Input the second number ")

result = number1 + number2
print "The sum is:", result
result = number1 * number2
print "The product of", number1, "and", number2, "is:", result
</pre></font>

To execute the python script copy the blue text from the screen
and paste it into a file. Save the file, for example, under the
name "add.py". Then type at the Unix prompt:

<font color=blue><pre>
python add.py
</pre></font>

<h4>1.1 Explanations</h4>

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td># <td>indicates a comment;  the line is ignored
<tr><td>input <td> reads from the keyboard
<tr><td>number1, number2, result <td> variables
<tr><td> + - * / <td> numeric operators
<tr><td> = <td> assignment operator
<tr><td>print <td> command
<tr><td> , <td> separates elements in a print statement
<tr><td>print ... ,<td> A comma at the end of a print statement suppresses newline
</table>

<h4>1.2 Exercise</h4>

1) Repeat the magician's exercise from last week, but this
time asking for user input.
Write a script that asks a user for a number. The script
adds 3 to that number. Then multiplies the result by 2, subtracts 4,
subtracts twice the original number, adds 3, then prints
the result. 

<h3>2 Sets</h3>

The code below shows how to form sets and how to use union,
intersection and difference. More operators for sets are in the table below.
Try this code:

<font color=blue><pre>
from sets import Set
students = Set(['Joe', 'Jane', 'Mary', 'Pete'])
programmers = Set(['Caroline', 'Tom', 'John', 'Pete'])
designers = Set(['Paul', 'Mary', 'Susan', 'Pete'])

print "These are the students:"
for student in students:
   print student,
print "!"

print "There are", len(students), "students."
print

people = students | programmers | designers           # union
print "All people:", people
print

student_designers = students & designers              # intersection
print "Students who also design:", student_designers
print

non_design_students = students - designers            # difference
print "Students who do not design:", non_design_students
</pre></font>

Note: do <b>not</b> name this file "sets.py". The reason is because 
"sets.py" is the name of a system file that you are
importing from. Using a predefined name, will not work. Furthermore,
Python may create a file "sets.pyc" in your directory, which will also
interfere with the predefined name and needs to be deleted.

<h4>2.1 Set operators</h4>

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><tt>len(s)</tt><td>cardinality of set <em>s</em>
<tr><td><tt>x in s</tt><td>test <em>x</em> for membership in <em>s</em>
<tr><td><tt>x not in s</tt><td>test <em>x</em> for non-membership in<em>s</em>
<tr><td><tt>s.issubset(t)</tt><td>test whether every element in
        <em>s</em> is in <em>t</em>
<tr><td><tt>s.issuperset(t)</tt><td>test whether every element in
        <em>t</em> is in <em>s</em>
<tr><td><tt>s | t</tt><td>Union: new set with elements from both
        <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>
<tr><td><tt>s &amp; t</tt><td>Intersection: new set with elements common to
        <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>
<tr><td><tt>s - t</tt><td>Difference: new set with elements in <em>s</em>
        but not in <em>t</em>
<tr><td><tt>s ^ t</tt><td>Symmetric difference: new set with elements in either
        <em>s</em> or <em>t</em> but not both
<tr><td><tt>s.copy()</tt><td>new set with a shallow copy of <em>s</em>

<tr><td><tt>s.add(x)</tt><td>add element <em>x</em> to set <em>s</em>
<tr><td><tt>s.discard(x)</tt><td>remove element <em>x</em> from set <em>s</em>
<tr><td><tt>s.clear()</tt><td>remove all elements from set <em>s</em>
<tr><td><tt>s == t</tt><td>test whether sets <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> are equal
<tr><td><tt>s != t</tt><td>test whether sets <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> are not equal
</table>

<h4>2.2 Copying and comparing sets</h4>

In order to create a new set which is a copy of an existing set, you
need "copy()". Try this code:

<font color=blue><pre>
from sets import Set
odd = Set([1,3,5])
even = Set([2,4,6])
copy1 = odd
copy2 = odd.copy()

print "Are copy1 and odd the same?", copy1 is odd
print "Are copy1 and odd equal?", copy1 == odd
print "Are copy2 and odd the same?", copy2 is odd
print "Are copy2 and odd equal?",copy2 == odd

odd.add(7)
print "odd:", odd
print "copy1:", copy1
print "copy2:", copy2
</pre></font>

<h4>2.3 Exercise for sets</h4>

2) Write a script that evaluates whether two sets are equal, subset of
each other or disjoint. The script outputs a sentence: "The two sets
are ..." stating whether they are equal, subset or disjoint. In order
to test the script use the sets odd and even or students and
programmers from the examples above. (Optional: a more complicated
version of this exercise would ask users to enter two sets by entering
one element at a time. The sets could be fixed length or the user
could be asked each time "would you like to add another element?".)

<h4>2.4 Exercises for writing scripts</h4>

The Set module is a general Python module. For the exercises below,
whenever you need SymPy functions, you need to import the functions.
For example, if you need Symbol and isprime, your
script needs to start with the following lines:

<font color=blue><pre>
from sympy import isprime, Symbol
</pre></font>

For efficiency it is best to only import what you really need.
<p>
3) This code prints the factors of numbers smaller than 10:

<font color=blue><pre>
has_factor = False
for number in range(1,11):
   for factor in range(2,number):
      if number % factor == 0:    ### the remainder is 0
         print factor,
         has_factor = True
   if has_factor == True:
      print "factor of", number
   has_factor = False
</pre></font>

Change the code so that it prints prime numbers.
<p>
4) Find a number n so that n**2 + n + 41 is not a prime number.
Hint: use the subs() function. Use
<font color=blue>for x in range(35,45)</font> and 
the sympy function isprime().

<p>
5) Write a script that calculates the Fibonacci numbers below 100.
Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... The next Fibonacci
number is calculated by adding the previous two numbers: 0 + 1 = 1;
1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3; 2 + 3 = 5; ...
<p>
To terminate the calculation, you can use: 
<font color=blue>while number < 100:</font>.

<p>
6) Write a script that computes all two element subsets of a set.
(Optional: think about how to write an algorithm that
computes all subsets of a set. This is actually quite difficult!
A set with n elements has 2<sup>n</sup> subsets. Thus the number
of subsets grows quickly. You have probably not yet learned enough
Python to implement this. Thus, for now just think about it.
What algorithm do you use when you write down all subsets
of a set with pen and paper?)
