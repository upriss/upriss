<h3>1 Descriptive statistics</h3>

For the exercises below download the 
<a href="friendsAndCars.csv">friendsAndCars.csv</a> file and save it on your I:-drive. 
Make sure that you don't have any empty lines at the end of the file.

<h4>1.1 Preprocessing</h4>

The friendsAndCars.csv file contains a relation between people and the
cars they own. In order to use descriptive statistics it is best to
calculate frequencies:
<li>people and how many cars they own, or
<li>cars and how many people own these cars.
<p>
The following Python script counts how often each type of car is 
in the list:

<font color=blue><pre>
from networkx import *
from operator import *
from sets import Set
F = read_edgelist("friendsAndCars.csv",delimiter=",",create_using=DiGraph())
a = [item[1] for item in sorted(F.edges(),key=itemgetter(1))]
for item in Set(a):
   print item + "," + str(a.count(item))
</pre></font>

You can save this as countFreq.py and run it on the command-line using

<font color=blue><pre>
python countFreq.py > CarsCounted.csv
</pre></font>

<h4>1.2 Using Excel (or OpenOffice)</h4>

If you double click on CarsCounted.csv, it will open in Excel.
<p>
Measures of central tendency and dispersion are functions in Excel.
For example, <font color=blue>AVERAGE(B1:B6)</font> calculates the
average (arithmetic mean) of the values in cells B1 to B6.
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>measure<th>formula
<tr><td>mode<td>MODE()
<tr><td>median<td>MEDIAN()
<tr><td>mean <td>AVERAGE()
<tr><td>variance<td>VAR()
<tr><td>standard deviation<td>STDEV()
</table>

<h4>1.3 Exercises</h4>

1) Calculate the measures in the table above for the Cars data.
<p>
2) How can you interpret the data: what is the central value? Is this
a normal distribution?
<p>
3) Produce a chart (diagram) of the data. In order to do this,
you should highlight the data and then select the chart wizzard.
You may want to create a label for each column first.
