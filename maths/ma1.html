<h4>1 Starting Python/SymPy</h4>

You need the following lines to create the settings required for the
exercises below.

<font color=blue><pre>
from __future__ import division
import sys
from sympy import *
sys.displayhook = pprint
</pre></font>

Read
<a href="ma0.html">these instructions</a> for more details
on how to setup your account and use Python on Socweb.

<p>

Note: the last line "sys.displayhook = pprint" is optional. It tries to
print the formulas in a nicer way, but this only works if the
character set of the client window is correctly configured.
So if the formulas have strange characters in them, don't use 
"sys.displayhook = pprint".

<h4>2 Using Python/SymPy in the interactive mode </h4>

Enter the following lines one at a time. You can either type
them in or copy and paste from here.

<font color=blue><pre>
6 * 12
n1 = 4
n2 = 5
n1 + n2
result = n1 * n2
result
</pre></font>

Thus, you can use python like a calculator! 
<p>
If you want to correct or change a previous line, you can
go back to that line using the uparrow key. 
<br>
Try this: change
<font color=blue>n1 + n2</font> to
<font color=blue>n1 + n2 + 1</font>.
<p>

There are several operators related to division:
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>division<td> <font color=blue>21 / 10 == 2.1</font>
<tr><td>integer division<td> <font color=blue>21 // 10 == 2</font> 
<tr><td>remainder<td> <font color=blue>21 % 10 == 1</font>
</table>
<p>
Note: the "/" operator only works in this manner because you executed 
earlier: "from __future__ import division".
<p>
Two equal signs (==) are used to test for equality.

<h4>3 Examples of simple calculations</h4>

In some cases SymPy does not provide a numerical result, but only
transforms the expressions. For example, <br>sqrt(2) = 2**(1/2)
(or &nbsp; &radic; 2 = 2<sup>1/2</sup>).<br>
If you want to see a numerical result use N(). 
Try the following:

<font color=blue><pre>
2**3
pi
N(pi)
sqrt(2)
N(sqrt(2))
sqrt(2)*pi
N(sqrt(2)*pi)
a = Rational(1,2)
b = Rational(3,4)
a + b
a + b == 5/4
</pre></font>

By the way, the last four lines show that

<pre>
1   3   1 * 2   3   5
- + - = ----- + - = -
2   4     4     4   4
</pre>

Hopefully, you still remember this from School!

<h4>4 Arithmetical operator precedence</h4>

What is <font color=blue>3**2*4 + 2/5</font>?<p>
The precedence is as follows:
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>1.<td>exponentiation <td> **
<tr><td>2.<td>multiplication, division, integer division, remainder <td> *, /, //, %
<tr><td>3.<td>addition, subtraction <td> +, -
<tr><td>4.<td>comparison <td>==, <, <=, >, >=, !=
</table>
<p>
Try the following expressions and observe how precedence is applied:

<font color=blue><pre>
1 + 2 * 3 + 4
1 + (2 * 3) + 4
(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)
2**3 + 1
2**(3 + 1)
4 == 3 + 1
(4 == 3) + 1
</pre></font>

<h4>5 Using variables</h4>

Programming variables (<font color=blue>n1 = 4; result = n1 + 1</font>)
are different from mathematical variables (<font color=blue>
x = Symbol('x'), y = Symbol('y')</font>). Programming variables
have a current value assigned. They can be assigned a new value at
any time. Mathematical variables express an unknown constant. 
For example, try the expressions below. 
Don't worry if you don't remember the mathematical details for all of
these from School. The point of these exercises is to show how CAS
software can solve in seconds, what might take a long time to achieve
with pen and paper.

<font color=blue><pre>
x = Symbol('x')
y = Symbol('y')
x+y+x-y
((x+y)**2).expand()            ### expands expressions
(x+y+x-y).subs(x,13)           ### substitutes a value
together(1/x + 1/y)            ### combines several fractions into one
diff(x**3 + x**2 + 3 * y, x)   ### differentiates an expression
integrate(6*x**5, x)
solve(x**2 -1, x)              ### solves algebraic equations
solve([x + 5*y - 2, -3*x + 6*y - 15], [x, y])
Integral(x**2, x)              ### prints an integral function
</pre></font>

<h4>6 Python Exercises</h4>

1) A magician asks a person to think of a number, then
add 3 to that number. Then multiply the result by 2, subtract 4,
subtract twice the original number, finally add 3. Then the
magician correctly guesses that the result is 5. <br>
Write a formula for this and test it with Sympy. You don't need
solve() for this because the result is deterministic. Can you
simplify the formula with pen and paper so that it reduces to 5?
<p>
2) Solve the equation: 7x + 3(x + 1) = 2x/4 - 1<br>
Hint: you need to insert the correct operators and transform the
equation so that one side says 0. You then apply the solve() function
to the side of the equation which does not say 0.
<p>
3) Which of the following are equal?<br>

x**2 - 1<br>
(x + 1) * ( x + 1)<br>
(x - 1) * ( x + 1)<br>
x**2 + 2* x + 1<br>
Hint: python will not automatically expand the expressions.
In order to compare expressions (with ==), you need to use
the expand() function.
<p>

4) a) Substitute x = 1 in x * (x**2 +5), then expand the expression;<br>
b) substitute x = x + 1  in x * (x**2 +5) then expand the expression.<p>
(The background for this exercise is mathematical induction which is a
method of proof by showing that a) a fact holds for 1 and b) if it holds for
x, it also holds for x +1. In this case, the goal is to prove that
x * (x**2 +5) is divisible by 6 if x is any integer. The proof is 
successful if the result from a) is a multiple of 6 and all summands
in the result from b) are either divisible by 6 or by x because 
it was assumed that x is divisible by 6.)


<h4>7 Web Exercise</h4>

5) Apart from the prime numbers discussed in the lecture,
there are many other number sequences studied in mathematics
and some other fields. Luckily, there are resources
on the web that can be used to identify the sequences.
Use the <a href="http://oeis.org">
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> to identify the following
sequences. (Don't read all the details on that site and don't
worry if you don't understand everything.)
<p>
For the first two sequences and the last one, you could try to guess
what principle is used to build them before you look them up. These
sequences are built using a simple construction.

<p>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
<p>
1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120
<p>
70, 836, 4030, 5830, 7192, 7912, 9272
<p>
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31
<p>
4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5
