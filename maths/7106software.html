<h4>Python FAQ</h4>

<li><b>I copied your code into UltraEdit/Notepad++ but it does not seem
to work.</b><br>
Unix and PCs have different characters for line and file endings. Normally
UltraEdit and Notepad can deal with that, but, if not, you may need to change
your settings in these editors. In UltraEdit this can be done in
"Advanced-Configuration-File Handling". Another possibility is to use
<font color=blue>dos2unix -c ISO filename</font> on the command-line. 
Then open the file with nano and delete any control characters that may have been
left. 

<!--<li><b>How do I find out whether a graph is bipartite?</b><br>
For the coursework, you don't need NetworkX to determine this. Just
looking at the data should be enough to determine which one is
bipartite and which one is not.<br>
If you are using NetworkX, keep in mind that the is_bipartite()
function has different results depending on whether the graph is
directed or not.-->

<!--<li><b>There seem to be several possible answers for some of the
questions about data analysis in the coursework</b><br>
That is correct. You need to decide which representation is more
interesting.-->

<li><b>Why do I not see any output when I execute a script whereas it
works fine using the interpreter?</b><br>
The interpreter automatically prints results. For example, if you type
"N(pi)" the interpreter prints the value of pi. If you do the same in a script,
there will be no output. In order to see output from a script you need 
to print it ("print N(pi)").

<li><b>Why are there funny characters on the screen?</b><br>
The command "sys.displayhook = pprint" uses UTF-8 characters to
display mathematical formulas in a nicer format. Unfortunately, this
does not always work perfectly when the client is on a PC and the
server is Unix. To disable the display hook command temporarily, type<br>
sys.displayhook = sys.__displayhook__<br>
To disable the command permanently, delete that line from your .pythonstartup file.
<li><b>Why are my commands for sets not working properly</b><br>
You'll need <font color=blue>from sets import Set</font> for
the exercises to work properly. Otherwise, you would be using the sets
module from SymPy, which is different from the one in Python.
<li><b>Why is this code not working even though nothing seems wrong?</b><br>
Are you maybe reusing a name which is predefined by Python or by your
program? You may not be getting a warning if you are overwriting a
predefined name or if you are using the same name for a function and a
variable, etc, but your code won't work.

<a name="install">
<h4>Installing Python on your own computer</h4>

You can login to the university server remotely (see below). Therefore
it should  not be necessary for you to install Python on your own
computer. If you do want to run it yourself, make sure that you have a
version after 2.4 (for example, Python 2.6.4). I have not tested any
code on Python 3 yet. Python is pre-installed on Mac OS X and Linux
computers. For PCs you can get it from:
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/">Python downloads</a>.
<br>
You also need <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/">SymPy</a> for
most of the exercises.

<a name="dcs">
<h4>Using your i-drive/Socweb/DCS</h4>

<li>General <a href="ma0.html">instructions</a> on using Python on Socweb/DCS.
<li>You can edit the files on the I:-drive using Notepad++ or UltraEdit
because the I:-drive provides access to the same files as the ssh window. 
Don't use plain Notepad, Word or WordPad.
If you do not have an I:-drive,
you need to map it: Go to All Programs -> School of Computing ->
Unix -> Map Unix drives.
<li>Unix <b>editor:</b> nano
<li><b>Arrow keys etc:</b>
Use the arrow keys to repeat a previous command.
Use the tab key to complete a filename.
<li>In nano, you can use Ctrl-K to delete/cut a line and Ctrl-U to 
get it back (paste). You can cut/uncut several adjacent lines in one go.

<a name="home">
<h4>Connecting from a home computer</h4>

A secure shell (SSH) client is needed. On Linux and Mac OS X, such a client 
is usually pre-installed (type "ssh" at the command-line). For PCs there are several
clients freely available for download, such as 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
or a GUI ftp client such as
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winscp/">WinSCP</a>. 
The address for the
server is <font color=red>socweb8.napier.ac.uk</font>.
