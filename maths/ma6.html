This continues from last week. The NetworkX modules need to be imported:

<h3>1 Analysing relations</h3>

Download the file <a href="friends.csv">friends.csv</a> and save it on
your I:-drive. This is a comma-separated variable (csv) file.
You can look at the file if you open it
in Wordpad. If you double click a csv-file, it will open in Excel.
<p>
The file contains a binary relation which can be
represented as a graph using:

<font color=blue><pre>
F = read_edgelist("friends.csv",delimiter=",",create_using=DiGraph())
</pre></font>

(Notes: F is specified as a directed graph because whether someone calls
someone else a "friend" may not be symmetric. <br>
If you create a csv file yourself, make sure that it does not contain any
blank lines at the end of the file.)

<h4>1.1 Exercises</h4>

1) Something to think about: What is the domain/co-domain for 
the friends relation?
<p>
2) Create a gif file for F. Try different layouts.
Which layout seems most suitable? Is it easy to see
who is considered "friend" by most people and who has the most friends?

<h4>1.2 Calculating Google's PageRank</h4>

PageRank is an algorithm that calculates the "relative importance" of
nodes in a directed graph. Basically, nodes that have more incoming edges are
more important. Edges coming from more important nodes count more
than edges coming from less important nodes.
<p>
The code below calculates the PageRank for each node in F and then
prints a list of nodes in decreasing order of importance.

<font color=blue><pre>
pg = pagerank(F)
for item in sorted(pg.iteritems(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True):
&nbsp; &nbsp;  print item
</pre></font>

Who is considered "friend" by most people according to PageRank?
Who has the least friends?

<h4>1.3 Exercise</h4>

3) Calculate the reverse graph using <font color=blue>F.reverse()</font>,
i.e., if (John,Paul) is in the original, then (Paul,John) is in the
reverse graph.
<p>
4) Calculate the PageRank of the reverse graph. Create gif files for
both F and the reverse graph. Answer the following questions based
on what you observe in the pictures and the PageRank data:<br>
<li>Why is Claire high in F and low in the reverse graph? 
<li>Why are Helen and Sue highly ranked in F and in the reverse graph?
<li>What does this mean for websites: how can a website achieve a high
PageRank in Google?

<h3>2 Small-world networks</h3>

A small-world network has a small average shortest path
lenght (eg below 6) and an average clustering coefficient that is 
larger than the clustering coefficient of a random graph 
with the same number of nodes and edges.
The average clustering coefficient determines whether the neighbours
of nodes are also connected and thus the graph forms clusters. 
<p>
Using
<font color=blue><pre>
average_shortest_path_length(G)
average_clustering(G)             ### for the clustering coefficient
gnm_random_graph(n, m)            ### for a random graph with n nodes, m edges
G.to_undirected()                 ### returns an undirected graph from DiGraph
G.number_of_nodes()
G.number_of_edges()
</font></pre>

<h4>2.1 Exercise</h4>

5) Determine whether the friends graph is a small-world network.


<h3>3 Exercise with pen and paper</h3>

Suppose you are going to a party with your girlfriend/boyfriend. 
There are three other couples at the party. Several people shake
hands. Obviously nobody shakes hands with themselves or their
girlfriend/boyfriend. Nobody shakes hands with the same person
more than once. At the end of the party, you ask everybody
including your girlfriend/boyfriend
how many hands they have shaken. Each person gives a different
answer.
<p>
Can you figure out how many hands you shook and how many hands your
girlfriend/boyfriend shook?
<p>
Hints: 

<li>Consider this a graph problem where the nodes are people
and the edges are handshakes. 

<li>What is the maximum number of handshakes possible for a single
person in this graph? What is the minimum number?

<li>Because each person gives a different answer, you can figure out 
what the answers must have been.

<li>Insert edges into the graph, starting with the person with the
most handshakes and then the one with the second most handshakes.
