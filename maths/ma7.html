<h3>1 Using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) software</h3>

Download the file <a href="friendsAndCars.csv">friendsAndCars.csv</a>
file and save it on your I:-drive. (This is the same file as used in
the statistics exercises).
<p>
Convert the csv file into an FCA format using:
<font color=blue><pre>
/home/staff/cs170/fcastone friendsAndCars.csv friendsAndCars.cxt
</pre></font>
<p>
If that does not work, save the file from
<a href="http://www.dcs.napier.ac.uk/~cs170/fcastone">here</a> as
fcastone in your current directory and run 
<font color=blue><pre>
perl fcastone friendsAndCars.csv friendsAndCars.cxt
</pre></font>
in that directory.
<p>
(If you are not using Socweb, you would need to download the FcaStone software
from <a href="http://fcastone.sourceforge.net/">http://fcastone.sourceforge.net/</a>.
Unzip the file; find the file called fcastone;
change its permissions to executable using chmod 755 fcastone). 
<p>
Download ConExp from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/conexp/">here</a>.
Double click the file to unzip it. Then go into the folder and double
click on the conexp.bat file (or the conexp.jar file depending on your
settings).
<p>
Once ConExp is running:

<ul>
<li>click on "Open File" and open the FriendsAndCars.cxt file
<li>click on "Build Lattice" 
<li>make the window larger
<li>change the following drawing options:
<ul><li>Attribs: Show multi-labels
<li>Objects: show multi-labels
</ul>
<li>change "Draw Node" to "Fixed radius" 
<li>click on the nodes and move them around until there are no overlapping lines
and labels in the diagram.
</ul>

You can save all of the data by clicking "Save File" (in the top bar)
or save/export the lattice to a png or jpg file by clicking on 
"save lattice image" just to the right of the image.

<h3>2 More exercises using Conexp</h3>

Enter the context of the animals from the 
lecture (Garfield, Socks, ...). It is probably best to 
first delete the objects and attributes that you 
don't need (by highlighting and right clicking).
<p>
After you entered the data, its probably a good idea to save the file.
(Be careful NOT to click the "open new file" button at this point
because that would delete your data.)

<ul>
<li>Click on Build lattice 
<li>Click on "Start Attribute Exploration"
<li>Accept all questions except when it asks you whether all cartoon animals 
are mammals. Enter Donald Duck as a counter example. (Explanation: when it asks
you whether "dog, cat, mammal" implies "cartoon, real, tortoise" and so 
on, you need to click "accept" because no object can be dog and cat at the
same time. That means that the premise of this implication is empty and 
thus always true.)

<li>Click on "Context Editor" to see whether Donald has been added.
<li>Click on "Lattice Diagram". Click the checkbox on the right next to 
Donald (or click "Select all objects"). 
<li>Notice how the diagram has now changed. 
</ul>


Go back to the Context Editor and add a new object called "Daisy" and
give her the attributes "cartoon" and "tortoise". 

Click on "Build lattice" and see if you can arrange the messy diagram
in a more readable fashion.
