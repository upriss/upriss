<h3>1 Recursive functions</h3>

Try the following two function definitions. Note: you need a blank
line at the end of a function definition. 
<p>
Calculating the sign (-1,1 or 0) of a number:

<font color=blue><pre>
def sign_function(x): 
&nbsp; if x < 0: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; return -1 
&nbsp; elif x == 0: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; return 0 
&nbsp; else: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; return 1 
&nbsp; &nbsp;
print sign_function(8) 
</pre></font>

The sign function is a function, but <b>not a recursive</b> function.
The <b>following function is recursive</b> because it calls itself.
This means that the name of the function shows up in a return statement.
<p>
Calculating factorials:

<font color=blue><pre>
def fact(n): 
&nbsp; if n == 0 or n == 1: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; return 1 
&nbsp; else: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; return (n * fact(n-1)) 
&nbsp;
print fact(7) 
</pre></font>

<h4>1.1 Exercises</h4>

1) Write a recursive function fibo(x) that calculates the Fibonacci numbers.
The conditions should be: 
<li>fibo(1) returns 0
<li>fibo(2) returns 1
<li>fibo(x) for x < 1 returns a message saying that x must be > 0
<li>fibo(x) for x > 2 contains a recursive call to fibo(x-1) and fibo(x-2)

<p>

2) Write a recursive function that determines whether a word is a 
palindrome (i.e. it reads the same in either direction, such as
radar, civic, rotator). Hints: 
<li>write conditions for words of length 0 and 1
<li><font color=blue>len(word)</font>  returns the length of word
<li><font color=blue>word[0]</font>  shows the first character;
<li><font color=blue>word[len(word)-1]</font>  shows the last character
<li><font color=blue>word = word[1:len(word)-1]</font> 
removes the first and last character.

<p>

3) Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers using the
Euclidean algorithm: 
<li>using numbers m and n;
<li>if n = m, you are finished;
<li>otherwise, sort them so that m < n;
<li>if m = 0, return n; 
<li>otherwise, return the greatest common divisor of (m, n % m).
<p>
For example: find the greatest common divisor of 26 and 14.<br>
m = 14; n = 26<br>
26 % 14 = 12<br>
find the greatest common divisor of (14, 12)<br>
m = 12; n = 14<br>
14 % 12 = 2<br>
find the greatest common divisor of (12, 2)<br>
m = 2; n = 12<br>
12 % 2 = 0<br>
find the greatest common divisor of (2, 0)<br>
m = 0; n = 2<br>
return 2

<p>

4) Optional exercise: write a recursive function that checks whether an
expression contains matching, nested brackets. For example, the
expression "(c(()b))" is ok, whereas ")n()" is not. The brackets must
be nested one inside the other, thus, "()()" is not ok.

<h3>2 Properties of functions</h3>

Many mathematical properties and points of functions can be read from the 
graph of a function:
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>properties/points<th>graph
<tr><td>domain<td>x-values for which the function is defined
<tr><td>range/image (a subset of the co-domain)
<td>y-values which the function actually takes
<tr><td>symmetric<td>mirrored along y-axis
<tr><td>continuous<td>can be drawn in one line without stopping 
<tr><td>bijective/strictly monotonous<td>
graph is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing
<tr><td>bounded<td>values don't approach infinity
<tr><td>root/zero<td>point where the graph intersects with x-axis 
<tr><td>local maximum or minimum<td>point where graph changes between rising/falling
<tr><td>global maximum or minimum<td>highest/lowest point of the graph
<tr><td>inflection point<td>graph changes its concavity
</table>
<p>

Use <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> to check
the properties of the following functions based on their graphs:

<ul>
<li>x**3
<li>x**2 * sin(x)
<li>(x**2 + y**2 -1)**3 - x**2 * y**3 = 0
<li>zeta(x)
</ul>

You can also use an on-line version of <a href="http://www.sagenb.org/">sage</a>
for this exercise, but it is more complicated. I have created a 
<a href="http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/1496/">worksheet</a> which
shows the solution to this exercise using sage.
