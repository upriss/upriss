<h4>CGI - Common Gateway Interface</h4>

<h4>1) A simple CGI script</h4>

CGI scripts do not run on any webserver. In SLIS, CGI scripts run
on "ella". The following instructions are correct for ella.
Other servers may be set up slightly differently.
On ella you should create two directories: "www" and a subdirectory
of "www" called "cgi". Both directories should be world readable
and executable. All html files should be in the www directory,
all cgi files in the cgi directory. The URL for
the html files is<br>
<font color=blue>http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~username/filename</font>.
The URL for cgi files is<br>
<font color=blue>http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~username/cgi/filename</font>
<br>
(Instead of putting the cgi files into the cgi directory they can
also be located somewhere else. But then they must be given a
".cgi" extension.)

<h4>Exercises</h4>

1.1) Save some simple html code such as
<p>
<font color=blue>
&#60;HTML&#62;<BR>
&#60;HEAD&#62;<BR>
&#60;TITLE&#62;
Hello World&#60;/TITLE&#62;<BR>
&#60;/HEAD&#62;<BR>
&#60;BODY&#62;<BR>
&#60;H1&#62;Greetings&#60;/H1&#62;<BR>
&#60;/BODY&#62;<BR>
&#60;/HTML&#62;<BR>
</font>
as a file in your www directory on ella. Look at it through a browser.

<p>

1.2) Save some simple cgi code such as
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
<br>
import cgi<br>
print "Content-Type: text/html\n"<br>
<br>
print """<br>
&#60;HTML&#62;<BR>
&#60;HEAD&#62;<BR>
&#60;TITLE&#62;Hello World&#60;/TITLE&#62;<BR>
&#60;/HEAD&#62;<BR>
&#60;BODY&#62;<BR>
&#60;H1&#62;Greetings&#60;/H1&#62;<BR>
&#60;/BODY&#62;<BR>
&#60;/HTML&#62;<BR>
"""<br>
</font>           
in your cgi directory. Run it on the command-line to check the syntax.
Change file permissions to executeable ("chmod 700 filename"
or "chmod u+x filename").
Look at it through your browser.
<p>

<h4>2) Tips for dealing with an "Internal Server error":</h4>
1) The first line of the script must contain the python command 
(#!/usr/bin/env python). There must not be a blank line (or anything
else) before the first line.<br>
2) The line <font color="blue">import cgi</font> 
must be somewhere at the beginning.<br>
3) The very first print statement of your script must be 
<font color="blue">print "Content-Type: text/html\n"</font><br>
4) The file permissions must be set to executable (chmod u+x filename).<br>
5) The script should be executed on the 
command line to check the syntax before looking at it through the
browser.<br>

<h4>3) Processing forms with CGI</h4>

Normal HTML:
<p>
<table border=1>

<tr><td><b>browser</b><td><b>server
<tr><td>user requests <br>
html document <td>
<tr><td><td> server finds HTML file <br>
 and sends page back
</table>
<p>
CGI:
<p>
<table border =1>
<tr><td><b>browser</b><td><b>server
<tr><td>user requests  <br> a form <td>
<tr><td><td>      server finds the HTML form <br>
 and sends it back to user
<tr><td>user fills out form <td>
<tr><td><td>         CGI application executes<br>
 program and sends results<br>
 back to user
</table>

<h4>Exercises</h4>

A sample form looks like this:
<p>
<font color=blue>
&#60;form action="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~username/cgi/example" 
method="post"&#62; <p>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="tea" checked &#62;   
Tea &#60;br&#62; <br>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="coffee" &#62; Coffee &#60;br&#62; <br>
&#60;input type="radio" name="drink" value="hot chocolate" &#62; Hot Chocolate
&#60;p&#62; <p>
&#60;input type="submit" value="Place order"&#62; <br>
&#60;/form&#62; <p>
</font>

3.1) Include the form in an html document on ella. Don't forget to 
change the URL of the form action so that it points to your 
cgi directory. (Other form elements can be found in this
<a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutors/forms.html">HTML forms 
tutorial</a>)

<p>
This is the source code of a cgi file that processes the form:
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
######### don't change the following three lines: ###########<br>
import cgi<br>
print "Content-Type: text/html\n"<br>
form = cgi.FieldStorage()<br>
<br>
## add a form.getvalue for each of the names in your form: ##<br>
drink = form.getvalue("drink")<br>
<br>
########## start of HTML code ###########<br>
print """ <br>
&#60;html&#62;<br>
&#60;head&#62;
        &#60;title&#62;What would you like to drink&#60;/title&#62;
&#60;/head&#62;<br>
&#60;body&#62;<br>
&#60;h4&#62;Your drink: &#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;<br>
""" <br>
############ end of HTML code #############<br>
<br>
if drink == "tea":<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        print "You requested tea."<br>
elif drink == "coffee":<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        print "You requested coffee."<br>
elif drink == "hot chocolate":<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        print "You requested hot chocolate."<br>
else:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        print "You need to select a drink!"<br>
<br>
########### start of HTML code ###########<br>
print """  <br>
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your visit. Please come again. &#60;p&#62;<br>
&#60;/body&#62;&#60;/html&#62;<br>
""" <br>
############# end of HTML code ##############<br>
</font>
<br>
3.2) Save the cgi file. Run it on the command line to check for 
syntax errors. 
<p>
3.3) Change the form method (in the html file) to "get". Reload the
form in your browser. Then submit the form.
Can you notice a difference in the address field of the browser? 
<p>
3.4) Add a checkbox to the form (such as "Do you want milk? Yes/No")
and a text area where customers can type in what kind of cake they
would like to order.
Change your cgi script so that it includes these in its reply,
such as "you requested tea with milk", "sorry we are out of
chocolate cake". The checkbox and text area must have distinct
names in the form. You need a line with form.getvalue() in your cgi file
for each name in your html form.

<h4>4) CGI without forms</h4>

The parameters that are passed to a CGI file do not need to come from
a form. They can also be added to the URL in the following manner:
<br>
<font color=blue>
&#60;A HREF="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~upriss/cgi/example?drink=tea"&#62;
</font>
<br>
If the form uses the "get" method, you can see the parameters.
Several parameters can be passed to a CGI file. 
They are separated by a &amp symbol. No space is allowed after the "?".
Blanks should be represented by "+".
<br>
<font color=blue>
&#60;A HREF="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~upriss/cgi/example?drink=hot+chocolate"&#62;
</font>

<h4>Exercises</h4>

4.1) Try using your cgi file by adding the parameters to the URL.
See what happens if the parameters are not tea or coffee or
hot chocolate.
<p>
4.2) Write an HTML file that does not contain a form but 
contains three links that send URLs with attached parameters
"tea", "coffee", "hot chocolate" to the cgi file. (In this
manner you can write cgi files that communicate with other 
cgi files on the web.)
<p>
4.3) (optional) Choose a search engine on the web and analyse how
they attach the search paramaters to the URL. Write a form that
sends data to that search engine.

<h4>5) Optional: Debugging</h4>

While it is easy to catch syntax errors (because the script can be
executed from the command line), it can be difficult to catch runtime
errors, such as missing input, missing files etc. The following example
shows how "try" can be put around a block of code. Any runtime errors
in this block will be caught by python and will be displayed on the
browser.
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
######### don't change the following six lines: ###########<br>
import cgi<br>
print "Content-Type: text/html\n"<br>
form = cgi.FieldStorage()<br>
import sys<br>
import traceback<br>
sys.stderr = sys.stdout<br>
<br>
## add a form.getvalue for each of the names in your form: ##<br>
drink = form.getvalue("drink")<br>
<br>

&#60;body&#62;<br>
&#60;h4&#62;Your drink: &#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;        elif drink == "coffee":<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    print "You requested coffee."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        elif drink == "hot chocolate":<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    print "You requested hot chocolate."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        else:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    print "You must choose a drink"<br>
<br>
except:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    print "\n\n&#60;PRE&#62;"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    traceback.print_exc()<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    print "&#60;/PRE&#62;"<br>

Change 'elif drink == "hot chocolate":' to 
'elif drink1 == "hot chocolate":' and see what happens.
