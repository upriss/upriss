<h4>1) Regular Expressions</h4>

A regular expression is a pattern that a string is searched for.
Unix commands such as "ls *.*" are similar to regular expressions,
but the syntax of regular expressions is more elaborated.
Several Unix programs (grep, sed, awk, ed, vi, emacs) use regular
expressions and many modern programming languages (such as
Java) also support them.

<p>
In Python, a regular expression is first compiled:
<p>
<font color=blue>keyword = re.compile(r"the ")</font>
<p>
(A string "the " is compiled and stored in the variable keyword.)
Then the search for the regular expression is executed:
<p>
<font color=blue>keyword.search(line)</font>
<p>
To search for all lines that do not contain the regular expression, use:
<p>
<font color=blue>not keyword.search(line)</font>
<p>
To search for a string variable, use:
<p>
<font color=blue>keyword = re.compile(variable)</font>
<p>
For a case insensitive search use:
<p>
<font color=blue>keyword = re.compile(r"the ",re.I)</font>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
import re<br>
<br>
# open a file<br>
file = open("alice.txt","r")<br>
text = file.readlines()<br>
file.close()<br>
<br>
# compiling the regular expression:<br>
keyword = re.compile(r"the ")<br>
<br>
# searching the file content line by line:<br>
for line in text:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    if keyword.search (line):<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;        print line,
</font>
<p>
To print both the string that was searched for and the line in
which it was found, the following script can be used: 
<font color=red>(But note that this version only works when
searching for lines that do contain a regular expression. 
It does not work, when searching for lines
that do <b>not</b> contain a regular expression.)</font>
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
import re<br>
<br>
# open a file<br>
file = open("alice.txt","r")<br>
text = file.readlines()<br>
file.close()<br>
<br>
# searching the file content line by line:<br>
keyword = re.compile(r"the ")<br>
<br>
for line in text:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    result = keyword.search (line)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    if result:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;        print result.group(), ":", line,
</font>

<h4>Exercises</h4>

<a href="#chars">List of special characters</a>
<p>
1.1 Retrieve all lines from alice.txt that do not contain "the ". 
Retrieve all lines that contain "the " with lower or upper case
letters (hint: use the ignore case option).
<p> 
2.1 Retrieve lines that have two consecutive o's.<br>
2.2 Retrieve lines that contain a three letter string consisting of
"s", then any character,
then "e", such as "she". <br>
2.3 Retrieve lines with a three letter word that starts with s and 
ends with e.<br>
2.4 Retrieve lines that contain a word of any length that starts with
s and ends with e. Modify this so that the word has at least 
four characters.
<br>
2.5 Retrieve lines that start with a. Retrieve lines that start with a and 
end with n.<br>
2.6 Retrieve blank lines. Think of at least two ways of doing this.<br>
2.7 Retrieve lines that do not contain the blank space character. <br>
2.8 Retrieve lines that contain more than one blank space character. 

<p>
3 Add a few lines with numbers etc. to the end of the alice.txt file
so that you can search for the following regular expressions: 
<p>
3.1 an odd digit followed by an even digit (eg. 12 or 74) <br>
3.2 a letter followed by a non-letter followed by a number <br>
3.3 a word that starts with an upper case letter <br>
3.4 the word "yes" in any combination of upper and lower cases letters <br>
3.5 one or more times the word "the" <br>
3.6 a date in the form of one or two digits, a dot, one or two digits,
a dot, two digits <br>
3.7 a punctuation mark <br>
<p>
4.1 
Write a script that asks users for their name, address and phone 
number. Test each input for accuracy, for example, there should be no letters 
in a phone number. A phone number should have a certain length. An 
address should
have a certain format, etc. Ask the user to repeat the input in case
your script identfies it as incorrect.
<p>
4.2 Concerning your projects: what kind of checking is needed to ensure 
that users fill in the forms in a sensible manner? Make certain that
your form can handle all kinds of input. For example, users can have
several first names, middle initials, several last names (which
may or may not be hyphenated).
