<H4>Introduction</H4>

This course introduces basic skills for programming and manipulation of
text-based information systems. Information management is a major task for
information professionals who are asked to extract information
from sources on the WWW, design interactive text-based web interfaces to
information systems, utilize text that is stored or is supposed to be stored
in a markup format or preprocess information for storage in databases.
This course teaches computer-based approaches to these tasks.
<p>
Currently the class is taught using Python/CGI. Python provides a good
introduction to general programming concepts. These concepts include basic
programming structures, such as control structures, file handling and
program design strategies. But they also include more advanced topics,
such as networking, text-based user interfaces, and basic
retrieval concepts. Python allows rapid prototyping which is appropriate for
applications in a fast changing environment such as the WWW. Furthermore, 
Python
is very suited for search engines, parsers and mark-up languages. Students
will develop a small information systems application as a project for this
class. The concepts are therefore not taught abstractly but as hands-on
experiences with WWW applications.

<H4>Course Objectives</H4>

<OL>
<LI>teaches basic programming concepts and structures. 
<LI>introduces basic information processing and management concepts. 
<LI>uses small scale but realistic examples of information management tasks. 
<LI>teaches the basics of Python and Python/CGI.
<LI>provides an introduction to more advanced topics such as object

</OL>

<H4>Prerequisites</H4>

<b>L401 (must be either completed in a prior semester or an approved waiver
must be in the student's file).</b><br>
<b>For non-SLIS students:</b> send an email message to upriss@indiana.edu
in which you describe your computer skills related to Unix, HTML,
HTML forms and general knowledge about the WWW.
<p>
Especially important for this class are: basic Unix skills,
i.e. understanding of the Unix directory structure and ability to edit and 
save files on a Unix computer; ability to create HTML web forms.

<H4>Class Organization</H4>

The class is taught as a combination of lecture and lab sessions.
The students will work on a semester team project.
The results of the projects will be 
presented during the last class session. 

<H4>Computer Lab</H4>

The lab session is taught in LI503 (a PC lab). All students must
<an href="http://account.ucs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/nid/">create an account</an>
on one of the IU Unix computers where Python is installed, such as 
Steel or Nations at least 24 hours before the first lab session.

<H4>Readings</H4>

The following book is highly recommended for this class:
<li> Core Python Programming (Prentice Hall Ptr Core Series)
by Wesley J. Chun. 1st edition (December 15, 2000) 
Prentice Hall PTR; ISBN: 0130260363;
(Note: this book can be a lot cheaper at Amazon than at a bookstore!)
<p>
The book is recommended but not required because there are many free
on-line resources available which some students may prefer to a book:
<li><an href="http://www.python.org/">General website on Python</an>
<li>
<an href="http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut/easytut.html">
An on-line tutorial</an>

<H4>Grading</H4>

The grades are given according to the SLIS grading standards. Good work 
that meets the course expectations will be assigned a grade of B. To get a 
higher grade than B, the students must demonstrate above average 
comprehension of the course materials, knowledge and/or effort. 
<P>
The final course grade will be computed for each student on the basis 
of grades assigned for the following: 
<p>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=1>
<TR><TD VALIGN="MIDDLE">Class contribution and mailing list discussions 
<TD VALIGN="MIDDLE">1/5 
<TR><TD VALIGN="MIDDLE">Project
<TD VALIGN="MIDDLE">2/5 
<TR><TD VALIGN="MIDDLE">Final exam 
<TD VALIGN="MIDDLE">2/5 
</TABLE>
<p>
Each student is expected to complete all course work by the end of the 
term. A grade of incomplete (I) will be assigned only if exceptional 
circumstances warrant. Late work will be accepted only at the discretion 
of the instructor and in every case will be automatically downgraded by 
1/3 grade (e.g., a B+ becomes a B, a B- becomes a C+, etc.). 
Students are required to maintain backup copies of their work so that they 
will not loose their work due to computer failures.
                                    

<H4>Class contribution and mailing list discussions</H4>

The class contribution grade will be calculated based on 
class attendance and contributions to class 
discussions and discussions on the majordomo distribution list 
(<B>upriss_l548@indiana.edu</B>).
It is required that every student 
demonstrate respect for the ideas, opinions, and feelings of all other 
members of the class. 

<H4>Projects: Teams and topics</h4>

Students will work on their projects in a team of 3-4 members.
The teams must be formed before the third week of class.
Each project will consist of developing an information processing 
or information management tool. The tool must have a CGI-based user 
interface. <p>

Examples for projects are: 
<ul>
<li>search engine
<li>library access tool
<li>data preprocessing tool (for connecting to a database)
<li>on-line greeting card service
<li>mail filtering system (using the standard Unix mail folder)
<li>content filter for webpages
<li>XML viewer
<li>indexing tool
<li>shopping cart
<li>calendar or scheduling tool
<li>link validator
</ul>
Other similar topics can be suggested by the students. 
Some of these topics require additional knowledge (such as databases or 
xml) and should only be chosen by students who have acquired such knowledge 
prior to this class. The students should  discuss their choice of 
topic with the instructor. 

<h4>Project presentation, assignments and final project report</h4>

The students will present their tools during the last lab session
(<b>April 22/23, 2002</b>). Parts of the projects (and its documentation)
will be handed in as assignments during the semester (see the Class 
Schedule). The source code of the tool should not be included in the 
documentation but it must be made available for evaluation by the instructor. 

<h4>Grading of the projects</h4>

A total of up to 70 points will be given for the project.
Each of the four assignments is worth 10 points, the presentation is
worth 10 points; and 20 points will be given for the project as a whole
when it is finished. 
<p> 
The project will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
<ul>
<li>
General project: The project should be appropriate
and feasible for Python/CGI. It should be neither too comprehensive nor
too simple. It should provide a service that is relevant 
and interesting for WWW users.
<li>
Performance: The software must run without errors
and must do whatever is claimed in the documentation. The software
should not be too slow, for example, it should not try to download
huge files or graphics from the WWW while the user is waiting.
<li>
Security: The software should not present an open security risk for
the CGI server, i.e. all security rules that are given in class
must be followed. The CGI scripts must not permit sending of 
unsolicited email messages. All copyright and privacy rules that 
are common law or issued by IU must be followed.
<li>
Usability: the software must be usable by a medium computer literate
person. The web pages and links must contain enough information
so that users know what the software does and what happens if they
follow links or press buttons. The structure of the pages should be 
clear, consistent and contain no redundancies.
The documentation should be clear and concise. 
The web pages and documentation should be spell- and grammar-checked.
<li>
Programming style: the source code of the script should be clear 
and should have appropriate comments.
</ul>

<H4>Final Exam</H4>

The final exam will be a take-home exam consisting of several small 
information management tasks for which the students will write 
appropriate Python 
scripts. The exam will be distributed at the conclusion of the class
on <b>April 15</b> and will be due on <b>April 29, 12.00 pm 
(Noon)</b>. Team work is not allowed for the final exam. 

<H4>A note on plagiarism</H4>

The students must clearly indicate if they use materials from other 
sources, such as textbooks or Internet webpages. Full citation information 
must be given for such sources. Academic and personal misconduct by 
students in this class are defined and dealt with according to the 
procedures in the <I>Code of Student Ethics</I>.
