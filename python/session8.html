<h4>Regular Expressions (continued)</h4>

<h4>1) Non-greedy Multipliers</h4>

By default the multipliers * and + are "greedy" which means they
match as many characters as possible. For example, 
r"\b.+\b" or r"\b.*\b" both match any non-empty line.
A question mark behind a multiplier forces it to be non-greedy.
Therefore r"\b.+?\b" matches the first word in a line whereas
r"\b.*?\b" matches an empty string. 

<h4>Exercise</h4>

1.1 Write a regular expression that finds html tags in a file and
prints them. (You can use the first lines of the 
source code of this web page to test it. )

<h4>2) Remembering Patterns</h4>

Sometimes it is useful to be able to select different substrings
from a string that is matched by a regular expression. For example,
the expression r"\d\d?\.\d\d?\.\d\d" matches a date format. To select
the date, month, year from this date format, parentheses are used
as shown in the following example:
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
import re<br>
<br>
date = raw_input("Please enter a date in the format mm.dd.yy ")<br>
<br>
keyword = re.compile(r"(\d\d?)\.(\d\d?)\.(\d\d)")<br>
<br>
result = keyword.search (date)<br>
if result:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   print "Month:", result.group(1)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   print "Day:", result.group(2)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   print "Year:", result.group(3)<br>
</font>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

2.1 Continue with the previous exercise but print the type of every
html tag your script finds, such as html, body, title, a, br.
<p>
2.2 Optional: Print all lines in the alice.txt file so that the first and
the last character in each line are switched.
<p>
<b>Optional material/exercise:</b>
<p>
2.3 Parenthesis can also be used to match repeated substrings within
one regular expression. In this case, the groups are denoted by
\1, \2, \3. For example, r"(.)\1" matches any character that
occurs twice. Note that this is different from r"..", which means
any two (possibly different) characters. 
Exercise: 
Print all lines in the alice.txt file that contain two double
characters.

<h4>3) Substitution</h4>

Instead of just printing the results of a search, Python can also
replace them similar to search/replace in a word processor. The 
following script replaces "t" with "T". In this case, "sub"
stands for "substitution". Note: whatever is searched for is a 
regular expression, but it is replaced by a string. That means
r"t" is a regular expression in the example but "T" is a string. 
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
import re<br>
<br>
# open a file<br>
file = open("alice.txt","r")<br>
text = file.readlines()<br>
file.close()<br>
<br>
# compiling the regular expression:<br>
keyword = re.compile(r"t")<br>
<br>
# searching the file content line by line:<br>
for line in text:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    print keyword.sub ("T",line),
</font>


<h4>Exercises</h4>

Using the alice.txt file replace
<br>
3.1 all upper case A by lower case a. <br>
3.2 Delete all words with more than 3 characters.
Hint: deleting means replacing with nothing.<br>
3.3 Print two blank space characters after the "." at the end of a sentence.
(Optional: Don't do this if the "." is the last character in a line.)<br>
3.4 Replace single quotes (' or `) by double quotes.
<p>
3.5 Modify your program from exercise 1.1, so that it deletes
all HTML markup.

<h4>4) Split and Join</h4>

Because regular expressions search a file line by line, it is 
sometimes necessary to reformat a file before searching so that
not too many items are on each line. The following example shows
how the alice.txt file can be reformatted using split and join
so that the line breaks
occur where the file had the punctuation marks "." or ",".
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
import re<br>
<br>
# open a file<br>
file = open("alice.txt","r")<br>
text = file.readlines()<br>
file.close()<br>
<br>
# join all of the lines together using " " as glue<br>
bigstring = " ".join(text)<br>
<br>
# delete newline characters and white space from the end of each line<br>
keyword = re.compile(r"\s*\n\s*")<br>
bigstring = keyword.sub (" ",bigstring)<br>
<br>
# split bigstring where "." or "," occurs<br>
keyword = re.compile(r"[\.,]\s*")<br>
text = keyword.split (bigstring)<br>
<br>
for line in text:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    print line
</font>   

<h4>Exercises</h4>

4.1 Modify the example so that it splits the file into words instead of
sentence parts.
<p>
4.2 Write a script that takes an HTML source file as input and prints
it so that a newline follows only "closing tags", i.e. tags that are 
of the form &#60/...&#62.
<p>
4.3 Optional: Parsing web pages:
<br>
If a CGI script downloads a page from the web, it will retrieve the
HTML source code. Look at several html pages on the web. 
Think about the following questions: How would you
extract information from them? How would you store that information in 
an array? How would a script search for words
(or regular expressions) in web pages? Besides the fact that you don't
know yet how a CGI script can download pages from the web, have you
learned enough so far that you could write such a script?
