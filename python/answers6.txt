3.4) Add a checkbox to the form (such as "Do you want milk? Yes/No")
and a text area where customers can type in what kind of cake they
would like to order. Change your cgi script so that it includes these
in its reply, such as "you requested tea with milk", "sorry we are out
of chocolate cake". The checkbox and text area must have distinct
names in the form. You need a line with form.getvalue() in your cgi
file for each name in your html form.

#!/usr/bin/env python
#
######### don't change the following three lines: ###########
import cgi
print "Content-Type: text/html\n"
form = cgi.FieldStorage()

## add a form.getvalue for each of the names in your form: ##
drink = form.getvalue("drink")
milk = form.getvalue("milk")
cake = form.getvalue("cake")

########## start of HTML code ###########

if drink == "tea":
    print "You requested tea"

4.2) Write an HTML file that does not contain a form but contains three 
links that send URLs with attached parameters "tea", "coffee", "hot 
chocolate" to the cgi file. 

<html>
<head>
<title>File that connects to a CGI program</title>
</head>
<body>

<h3>What would you like to drink?</h3>
