<h3>1) A first example "Hello World"</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# This program says "hello" to the world<br>
<br>
print "Hello World!"<br>
</font>
<p>
To execute the python script copy the blue text from the screen
and paste it into a file. Save the file, for example, under the
name "hello.py". Then type at the Unix prompt:

<font color=blue>
<p>
python hello.py
<p>
</font>
<p>

<b>Explanations</b>
<table border=1>
<tr><td># <td>indicates a comment;  the line is ignored
<tr><td>print <td> a command; prints the string between the quotes
</table>
<p>
<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
1.1) Add a second print statement to the script from the example.
(For example print "How are you?".)
<p>
1.2) Make some random changes, for example, delete the "#" before
"This program says ...".
In most cases you will get an error message. 
Fix the errors until the script executes again successfully.
<p>
1.3) Type just <font color="blue">python</font> at the command line.
This starts the interactive mode. You can now type commands. To
leave the interactive mode press the control key followd by
<font color="blue">D</font>. Note: in the interactive mode,
you don't need the word <font color="blue">print</font>. 
Just typing <font color="blue"> "Hello World"</font> will print it.

<h3>2) A second example </h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# A program for greeting people<br>
<br>
name = raw_input ("What is your name? ")<br>
print "Hello, " + name + "! How are you?"<br>
print "My name is" , name<br>
</font>
<p>

<b>Explanations</b>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>name <td> a variable for a "name"
<tr><td> = <td> an assignment operator
<tr><td> raw_input <td> input a string from the keyboard
<tr><td> + <td> concatenates strings
<tr><td> , <td> separates elements in a print statement
</table>
<p>            

<b>Exercises:</b><p>

2.1) What is the difference between using "+" and "," in a print statement?
Try it!<br>
2.2) Write a program that
asks two people for their names; stores the names in variables
called name1 and name2; says hello to both of them.

<h3>Operators for Numbers</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# A program for numbers<br>
#<br>
<br>
a = 3 - 4  + 10<br>
b = 5 * 6<br>
c = 7.0/8.0<br>
print "These are the values:", a, b, c<br>
print "Increment", a, "by one: "<br>
a = a +1<br>
print a<br>
print "The sum of", a, "and", b, "is"<br>
d = a + b<br>
print d<br>
number = input("Input a number ")<br>
print number
</font>      
<p>

<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
3.1) Execute the script. Make sure you understand every line.
<br>
3.2) Write a script that asks a user for a number. The script
adds 3 to that number. Then multiplies the result by 2, subtracts 4,
subtracts twice the original number, adds 3, then prints
the result.

<h3>Optional exercise</h3>

To execute a python script 
you can also change the program permissions to executable

<font color=blue>
<p>
chmod u+x program_name
<p>           
</font>

and then execute it by simply typing the program_name.
