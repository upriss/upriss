<h4>1) Creating Lists</h4>

<table border =2>
<tr><td>
zoo = ["monkey", "tiger", "eagle"]<td> # define a list
<tr><td>zoo[0]  <td> # a single element
<tr><td>zoo[0] = "gorilla" <td> # change an element
<tr><td>zoo.append("parrot") <td> # add elements at end of list
<tr><td>zoo = ["zebra","lion"] + zoo<td> # add elements at beginning
</table>
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# creating and modifying a list<br>
#<br>
<br>
zoo = ["monkey", "tiger", "eagle", "parrot"]<br>
<br>
print "The zoo has the following", len(zoo), "animals:", zoo<br>
<br>
print "The 1. animal is", zoo[0]<br>
print "The 2. animal is", zoo[1]<br>
print "The 1. and 2. animals are", zoo[:2]<br>
print "Animals 2. - 4. are", zoo[1:4]<br>
print "The animals after the 2. one are", zoo[2:]<br>
print "The last element is", zoo[-1]<br>
<br>
new_animal = raw_input("Which animal would you like to add? ")<br>
zoo.append(new_animal)<br>
print "The zoo has the following", len(zoo), "animals:", zoo<br>
<br>
new_animal = raw_input("Which animal should replace the monkey? ")<br>
zoo[0] = new_animal<br>
print "The zoo has the following", len(zoo), "animals:", zoo<br>
</font>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

1.1) Create a list that contains the names of 5 students of this class.
(Do not ask for input to do that, simply create the list.)
Print the list. Ask the user to input one more name and append it
to the list. Print the list.
Ask a user to input a number. Print the name that has that number as
index.
Add "John Smith" and "Mary Miller" at the beginning of the list
(by using "+"). Print the list.

<h4>2) More operators and functions for lists</h4>

<table border =2>
<tr><td>del zoo[0] <td> # delete an element by index number
<tr><td>zoo.remove("tiger") <td> # delete an element by value
<tr><td>zoo.insert(1, "elephant") <td> # insert an element
<tr><td>len(zoo) <td> # length of zoo
<tr><td>max(zoo) <td> # alphabetically first or smallest element
<tr><td>min(zoo) <td> # alphabetically last or largest element
<tr><td>new_zoo = zoo[:] <td># create a new copy of zoo
<tr><td>zoo.reverse() <td> # change the list to reverse order 
<tr><td>zoo.sort() <td> # change the list to alphabetical order
</table>
<p>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# Deleting elements from a list<br>
<br>
zoo = ["monkey", "tiger", "eagle", "parrot"]<br>
print "The zoo has the following", len(zoo), "animals:", zoo<br>
<br>
number = input("Which animal would you like to delete? \<br>
Input the number of the animal: ")<br>
if 0 <= number < len(zoo):<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    del zoo[number]<br>
else:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    print "That number is out of range!"<br>
print "The zoo has the following", len(zoo), "animals:", zoo<br>
<br>
new_animal = raw_input("Which animal would you like to delete? \<br>
Input the name of the animal: ")<br>
if new_animal in zoo:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    zoo.remove(new_animal)   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    print new_animal, "has been deleted"<br>
else:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    print new_animal, "cannot be deleted because it 
is not in the zoo"<br>
print "The zoo has the following", len(zoo), "animals:", zoo<br>
</font>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

2.1) Continue with the script from 1.1):
Print the list. Remove the last name from the list.
Print the list.
Ask a user to type a name. Check whether that name
is in the list: if it is then delete it from the list. Otherwise
add it at the end. 
Create a copy of the list in reverse order. Print the original
list and the reverse list.

<h4>3) For-statement with lists</h4>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# for statement<br>
#<br>
zoo = ["tiger", "elephant", "monkey"]<br>
for animal in zoo:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; print animal,<br>
print<br>
<p>
</font>

<h4>Exercises</h4>

3.1) Use the list of student names from exercise 2.1):
Create a for loop that prints for each student
"hello student_name, how are you?" where student_name is
replaced by the name of the student.
<p>
3.2) Optional: Use the list of student names from the previous
exercise. Create a for loop that
asks the user for every name whether they would like
to keep the name or delete it. Delete the names which the user
no longer wants. Hint: you cannot go through a list using a for
loop and delete elements from the same list simultaneously
because in that way the for loop will not reach all elements.
You can either use a second copy of the list for the loop condition
or you can use a second empty list to which you append the elements
that the user does not want to delete.

<h4>4) Input from a file</h4>

Click <a href="alice.txt">here</a> and save the file in your 
current directory under the name "alice.txt".
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# Program to read and print a file <br>
#<br>
file = open("alice.txt","r")<br>
text = file.readlines()<br>
file.close()<br>
<br>
for line in text:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    print line,<br>
print
<p>
</font>


<b>File handling</b>
<p>

<table border=2>
<tr><td>file = open("alice.txt","r")<td> open for reading
<tr><td>file = open("output.txt","w")<td> open for writing
<tr><td>file = open("output.txt","a")<td> open for appending
<tr><td>file.close()<td> close file
<tr><td>text = file.readlines()<td> read all lines into a list 
called "text"
<tr><td>line = file.readline()<td> read next line into a string
called "line"
<tr><td>file.writelines(text)<td> write list to file
<tr><td>file.write(line)<td> write one line to file
</table>
<p>

<b>Exercises</b>
<P>
4.1) Modify the program so that
the lines are printed in reverse order. <br>
4.2) Output to another file instead of the screen. First, let
your script overwrite the output file, then change the 
script so that it appends the output to an existing file.<br>
4.3) Modify the program so that 
each line is printed with a line number at the beginning.<br>

<h4>5) Optional Materials</h4>

Alternative method of reading a file. This method should be used
for files that are too large to be read into a list at once.
<p>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# Program to read and print a file <br>
#<br>
file = open("alice.txt","r")<br>
line = file.readline()<br>
<br>
while line:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     print line,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     line = file.readline()<br>
print<br>
<br>
file.close()
</font>
<p>
Since reading files from the operating system environment is a source
of errors, it is sometimes a good idea to add some code that detects
and deals with errors:

<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# Program to read and print a file <br>
<br>
import sys<br>
<br>
try:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;       file = open("alice.txt","r")<br>
except IOError:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;       print "Could not open file"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;       sys.exit()<br>
<br>

text = file.readlines()<br>
file.close()<br>
<br>
for line in text:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    print line,<br>
print
</font>
<h4>6) Optional: Dictionaries</h4>

Dictionaries
 are like lists whose indices are arbitrary numbers and strings.
They can also be thought of as
"database tables" with two columns (a "key" and a "value"
column).
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br>
#<br>
# a dictionary<br>
<br>
relatives ={"Lisa" : "daughter", "Bart" : "son", "Marge" : "mother",<br>
"Homer" : "father", "Santa" : "dog"}<br>
<br>
for member in relatives.keys():<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   print member, "is a", relatives[member]
</font>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
6.1) Create a second dictionary (such as "age") and print its values
as well.
