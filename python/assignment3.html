<title>Assignment 3</title>
<body>
The main part should give some indication of the general
structure of the project. 
<p>
Usually the main part contains
<p>
<li>  the "import cgi" statement
<li> the form.getvalue() function calls that retrieve the variables
from the form 
<li> the basic HTML code for a reply that will be sent to the user
(This can also be done in a function which should be included in this
assignment. The content of the reply that 
is sent to  the user does not have to be complete but a template 
should be provided.)
<li> some functions that, for example, deal with user input or searching.
These functions are not expected to be complete for this assignment
but they should be included without code, such as <p>
def search():<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; pass<p>
so that the script does not produce syntax errors.
<p>
Further Criteria for grading:
<p>
<li> the script must be executable without syntax errors
<li> the general outline of the project must be indicated by the names
of the subroutines
<li> the use of global variables should be avoided
