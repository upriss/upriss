1.1 

preliminary stuff that will be used later: 
compile regular expression for searching for closing_tags
compile regular expression for searching for opening_tags

define the find_closing_tags function:

    search for closing_tag in line
    if closing_tag is found:
       print the tag

define the find_opening_tags function:

    search for opening_tag in line
    if opening_tag is found:
       print the tag

main program: #############################

open a file with name "example.html" for reading
read the lines from the file
close the file 

print "these are the closing tags"

for each line in the text of the file:
    use the find_closing_tags function

print "these are the opening tags"

for each line in the text of the file:
    use the find_opening_tags function

2.1 

define the read_file function:
    
    open a file with name filename for reading
    read the lines from the file
    close the file 
    return the filecontent to the main program

define the write_file function:

    open a file with name filename for writing
    write the lines to the file
    close the file 

define the get_input function:

    ask the user to type some input
    append the user_input to the end of the filecontent
    return the filecontent to the main program

main program: ################################

use the read_file function, which reads a file with name "example.html"
use the get_input function, which obtains user input and 
       appends it to the filecontent
use the write_file function, which writes the filecontent to a file
       with filename "example.html"

show the file to the user (using the Unix command "more")

2.3


define the read_file function:
    
    open a file with name filename for reading
    read the lines from the file
    close the file 
    return the filecontent to the main program

define the write_file function:

    open a file with name filename for writing
    write the lines to the file
    close the file 

define the get_input function:

    ask the user to enter his/her first name
    ask the user to enter his/her last name
    ask the user to enter his/her email address
    append the user_input to the end of the filecontent
    return the filecontent to the main program

define the find_email function:

    ask the user to enter a last name
    compile a regular expression for searching for the pipe symbol
    for each line in the text of the file:
        split the line into a list at the pipe symbol    
        if the second element of the list is equal to the last name:
             print "Your email address is" 
             print the email address, which is stored in the third element 
                                                              of the list
   

main program: ################################

use the read_file function, which reads a file with name "example.html"
use the get_input function, which obtains user input and 
       appends it to the filecontent
use the write_file function, which writes the filecontent to a file
       with filename "example.html"
use the find_email function, which asks the user for a last name and
       then prints the corresponding email address
