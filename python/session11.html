<h4>CGI III: Maintaining State</h4>

If one form invokes another form, it is often the case that information
from the first form must be send to the second form. This is part of 
"maintaining state", i.e. maintaining accurate information between
different CGI scripts invoked by one user. There are three possibilities
to maintain state: <br>
a) send hidden text, <br>
b) write information to a file (on the server),<br>
c) set cookies (on the client). <br>

<h4>1) Hidden text</h4>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

1.1 Create a form that asks a user for his/her name and some comments.
Then create two CGI scripts that create a response. The first script
displays the information which the user has submitted ("Hello", name, ".
These are your comments:", comments) and asks the user whether he/she
really wants to submit the information. The second script is invoked
by the first one and displays "Thank you", name, ". Your comments 
have been submitted:", comments.
<p>
To implement this add a form and hidden tags to the first CGI script,
such as
<p><font color=blue>
print "&#60;input type='hidden' name='hiddenname' value='",name,"'&#62;"<br>
print "&#60;input type='hidden' name='hiddencomments' value='",
comments,"'&#62;"
</font><p>
The second CGI script retrieves these strings via
<p><font color=blue>
name = form.getvalue('hiddenname')<br>
comments = form.getvalue('hiddencomments')
</font><p>

<h4>2) Cookies</h4>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

2.1 Use a cookie instead of hidden text in the previous exercise.
<p>
The following code in the first CGI script sets a cookie. Note that
the cookie needs to be set before printing the Content-Type line but
after reading the form values. 

<p><font color=blue>
import Cookie<br>
C = Cookie.SimpleCookie()<br>
C["cookie_name"] = name<br>
C["cookie_comments"] = comments<br>
print C<br>
print "Content-Type: text/html\n"
</font><p>

The second CGI script retrieves the cookie:

<p><font color=blue>
import Cookie<br>
import os<br>
<br>
C = Cookie.SimpleCookie()<br>
C.load(os.environ["HTTP_COOKIE"])<br>
<br>
name = C["cookie_name"].value<br>
comments = C["cookie_comments"].value

<p></font>

(Note: The example above refers to session cookies that are not
permanently stored on the computer. I could not get the code above
to work for cookies that are stored on the computer, mainly because
on a PC the newline character is "\r\n" instead of "\n" and because
stored cookies need an expiration time. Something like the
following should work:
<p>
import time<br>
temp = time.strftime("%a, %d-%b-%Y ", time.gmtime()) <br>
hour = time.strftime("%H", time.gmtime()) <br>
hour = str(int(hour) + 1)<br>
if len(hour) <2 : hour = "0" + hour<br>
temp = temp + hour + time.strftime(":%M:%S GMT", time.gmtime()) <br>
<br>
cookiedata = name + "|" + comments<br>
print "Set-Cookie: nameandcomments="+cookiedata+"; expires=" + temp +"\r"<br>
print "Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r"


<h4>3) Writing to a file</h4>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

3.1 A hit counter: create a file that contains
only the number "0". Your CGI script must open that file for reading;
read the first line of the file into an integer; increase the 
number by one; close the file; open the file again for writing (not
appending); write the number to the file; close the file.
<p>
3.2 (Optional) Create yet another version of exercise 1.1 but
this time save the information to a file.
<p>
There are several problems involved with saving to a file because
several users can look at the CGI script at the same time. To 
keep track of which user wrote which comments, write user name
and comments to the file; send the user name as hidden text and 
use the name to retrieve the correct comments from the file.
