<h4>Exercises</h4>

1.1 Add further attributes to the  student class (phone number, email 
address, degree, etc).
<p>
1.2 Create a list of students. Let users add new students to the list.
Ask the user for the name of a student and then print his/her details.
<p>
1.3 Create a method creditHours  that computes the number of credit hours
for a student assuming that every class is a three credit class.
<p>                    
1.4 Create a class Employee that contains information
about names, ages and positions. What could be useful methods
for the class? 

<h4>2) Modules</h4>

Code can be stored in different files (modules) and can be imported. 
A module must have an extension "py". It should contain exactly one
class which has the same name as the module. To import a module from
the current directory the system path may need to be changed:
<p>
<font color=blue>
import sys<br>
sys.path.append(".")<br>
</font>
<p>
The Student module (in the file Student.py) can then be imported
with <font color=blue>from Student import *</font>. 
(<font color=blue>import Student</font> would also work but then
all methods would have to be prefixed with "Student.".)

<h4>Exercises</h4>

2.1 Using the previous example, 
separate the main code and the class definition. Save the class
definition as a module Student.py and import it into the file that
contains the main code.
