1.2) Write a script that asks someone to input their first name,
last name and phone number. If the user does not type at least
some characters for each of these, print "Do not leave any fields
empty" otherwise print "Thank you". (Hint: if a variable is empty,
its value will be "false".) 

#!/usr/bin/env python

fname = raw_input ("Please, type in your first name: ")
lname = raw_input ("Please, type in your last name: ")
phone = raw_input ("Please, type in your phone number: ")

if fname and lname and phone:
     print "Thank you!"
else:
     print "Do not leave any fields empty"

----------------------

1.3) Change the script so that the script prints "Thank you" if either
the first name or the last name or the phone number is supplied.
Print "Do not leave all fields empty" otherwise. 

#!/usr/bin/env python

fname = raw_input ("Please, type in your first name: ")
lname = raw_input ("Please, type in your last name: ")
phone = raw_input ("Please, type in your phone number: ")

if fname or lname or phone:
     print "Thank you!"
else:
     print "Do not leave any fields empty"


------------------

1.4) Change the script so that only first name and last name are required.
The phone number is optional.

#!/usr/bin/env python

fname = raw_input ("Please, type in your first name: ")
lname = raw_input ("Please, type in your last name: ")
phone = raw_input ("Please, type in your phone number: ")

if fname and lname:
     print "Thank you!"
else:
     print "Do not leave any fields empty"

------------------------

2.1) Write a program that asks a user to input a color.
If the color is black or white, output "The color was black or white". 
If it starts with a letter that comes after "k" in the alphabet,
output "The color starts with a letter that comes after "k" in the
alphabet". (Optional: consider both capitalized and non-capitalized
words. Note: the order of the alphabet in Unix and Python
is: symbols, numbers, upper case letters, lower case letters.)


#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# guess a color
#
answer = raw_input ("Please enter a color: ")

if (answer == "black") or (answer == "white"):
   print "The color was black or white."
elif answer >= "k":
   print "The color starts with a letter that comes after \"k\" in the alph\
abet."

------------

2.2) Write a program that asks a user to input a number.
If the number equals "5", output "My lucky number".
If the number is larger than 10, output "What a large number!".
In all other cases, output "That's not my lucky number."


#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# guess a number
#
answer = input("Please enter a number: ")

if answer == 5:
        print "My lucky number."
elif answer > 10:
        print "What a large number!"
else:
        print "That's not my lucky number."

--------

4.2) Ask the user to type something (use raw_input). To find out whether 
the input was a number, compare whether the input is after "0" and before ":
" in alphabetical order. If it is a number convert it into an integer.
Then print the input and its type.
(Note: this won't work if the user enters a real number. See below.) 

something = raw_input ("Please type something ")
        
if something >= "1" and something < ":":
   something = int(something)
print "The input", something, "is of type", type(something)



6.2) Ask the user to type a Python object. (That means numbers can be typed 
directly but strings must be enclosed in quotes.) Use "input" instead of 
"raw_input". Check the type of the user-input in the following manner: 
inlcude the line "import types" at the beginning of your script. Then 
compare the type of the user-input to the objects types.IntType, 
types.FloatType and types.StringType. Print "The input was an integer", 
"the input was a real number", "the input was a string", respectively.

import types

something = input ("Please type something ")

if type(something) is types.IntType:
   print "The input was an integer"
elif type(something) is types.FloatType:
   print "The input was a real number"
elif type(something) is types.StringType:
   print "The input was a string"
