<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
Modify the program from above so that it asks users to "guess the lucky 
number". If the correct number is guessed the program stops,
otherwise it continues forever.
<p>
Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to 
guess again each time. Use two variables, $number for the number
and $answer for the answer to the question whether they want to
continue guessing. 
The program stops if the user guesses the correct number or
answers "no". (In other words, 
the program continues as long as a user has not answered "no" and 
has not guessed the correct number.)
<p>
<b>Using a counter</b>
<p>
Write a program that asks five times to guess the lucky number.
Use a while loop and a counter, such as
<p>
<font color=blue>
$counter = 1;<br>
while ($counter <= 5) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;print "Type in the $counter number\n";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;$counter++;<br>
}</font>
<p>
The program asks for five guesses (no matter whether the correct
number was guessed or not).
If the correct number is guessed, the program outputs
"Good guess!\n", otherwise it outputs "Try again!\n". 
After the fifth guess it stops and prints "Game over.\n".
<p>
<b>Last</b>
<p>
In the previous example, insert "last;" after the "Good guess!\n"
print statement. "last" will terminate the while loop so that
users do not have to continue guessing after they found the number. 
<p>
<b>Setting a flag</b>
<p>
Let users again guess five numbers but this time do not tell
them immediately whether they were successful or not. After the
while loop is finished print "The correct number was guessed\n"
if the number was among the five guesses and "The correct number
was not among them\n" otherwise. To implement this use a variable
called $flag that is set to true (or 1) as soon as the number is guessed.
After the while loop is finished,
the truthvalue of $flag is evaluated in an if statement.

<p>
<b>For </b>
<p>
<img src="s23.jpg">
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# for statement<br>
#<br>
for ($i =1; $i <= 10; $i++){<br>
	print "$i ";<br>
	}<br>
</font>
<p>

<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
Modify the counter program from above using a for loop
so that it asks the user for five guesses and 
then stops. Use "last" to terminate the for loop as soon as the
correct number is guessed.
