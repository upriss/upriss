3) Create a form that asks a user for his/her name and some comments. 
Then create two CGI scripts that create a response. The first script 
displays the information which the user has submitted ("Hello $name. 
These are your comments: $comments") and asks the user whether he/she 
really wants to submit the information. The second script is invoked by 
the first one and displays "Thank you $name. Your comments have been 
submitted: $comments". 

Form:

<form action='yourcgifile' method='post'>
Name: <input type='text' name='name' ><p>
Comments: <input type='text' name='comments' ><p>
<input type='submit' value='next'>
</form>      

First CGI Script:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use CGI qw(:standard);
my $name= param("name");
my $comments = param("comments");
print header();
print "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Maintaining State</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
     <form action = 'yourcgifile' method='post'>
     Hello $name! Do you really want to submit these comments?<p> $comments
     <input type='hidden' name='name' value=\"$name\"><p>
     <input type='hidden' name='comments' value=\"$comments\"><p>
     <input type='submit' value='yes'>
     </form>";
print end_html();     

4) Use a cookie instead of hidden text in the previous exercise

First CGI file:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use CGI qw(:standard);
my $name= param("name");
my $comments = param("comments");
$cookiedata = $name."|".$comments;
$cookie = cookie(-name=>'nameandcomments',-value=>"$cookiedata",
       -expires=>'+1h');
print header(-cookie=>$cookie);
print "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Maintaining State</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
     <form action = 'yourcgifile' method='post'>
     Hello $name! Do you really want to submit these comments?<p> $comments
     <input type='submit' value='yes'>
     </form>";
print end_html();     

Second CGI file:

use CGI qw(:standard);
print header();
print "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Maintaining State</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H3>Reply</h3>";
$cookiedata = cookie(-name=>'nameandcomments');
($name, $comments) = split(/\|/,$cookiedata);
print "<p> Hello $name. Here are your comments: <p> $comments";
print end_html();

6) Hit counter: create a file that contains only
the number "0". Your CGI script must open that file for reading; read
the first line of the file into a scalar variable; increase the number by
one; close the file; open the file again for writing (not appending); write
the number to the file; close the file. 

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use CGI qw(:standard);

print header(); 
print start_html("Hit Counter");
open(FILE, "output.txt");
$counter = <FILE>;
$counter++;
close(FILE);

open(FILE, ">output.txt");
print FILE $counter;
close(FILE);

print p("You are the $counter visitor of this page");
print end_html();
