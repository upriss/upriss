<h3>Programming in the large</h3>

<h3>Subroutines</h3>
<b>Example:</b>
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>
# main program<p>
open(IN,"test.html");<br>
@file=&#60IN&#62 ;<br>
foreach $line (@file){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   find_closing_tags($line);<br>
}<br>
close IN;<p>
# end of main<br>
sub find_closing_tags {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $line = $line;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        if ($line =~ /(&#60\/.*?&#62)/i){<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;     print "$1\n";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
</font>
<p>
Note: Instead of <font color=blue>my $line = $line;</font> it would
be better to write <font color=blue>my $line = $_[0];</font> because
variables should be sent to subroutines in the @_ array. But the first
version is easier to remember and works in many cases.
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
Add a second subroutine to the example that prints all tags that
are not closing tags. Before the subroutines are called, let the main 
routine print a heading "these are the opening tags" and 
"these are the closing tags". (Note: this script only finds the
first tag in every line. To change that so that it finds all tags
you would have to insert line breaks after the tags - compare last week's
exercise 5).

<p>
<b>Example:</b>
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>
#<br>
# main soubroutine<br>
#<br>
$file="input.txt";<br>
@textfile= read_file($file);<br>
push (@textfile,"this is the last line");<br>
write_file($file,@textfile);<br>
system('more input.txt');<br>
##############################<br>
sub read_file {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $inputfile = $file;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;open (INPUT, $inputfile);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;@text = &#60INPUT&#62 ;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;chomp @text;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;close (INPUT);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;return @text;<br>
}<br>
#########################<br>
sub write_file {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;my $outputfile = $file;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;my @text = @textfile;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;open (OUTPUT, "&#62$outputfile");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;foreach $line (@text) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;print OUTPUT "$line\n";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;close (OUTPUT);<br>
}<p>
</font>
<p>  
The main routine sends $file as argument
to the subroutine read_file and receives
@text from it as return value. The 
subroutine sends values to the main routine via the "return"
function.
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
Write a third subroutine for the script. The subroutine is called
get_input. It takes @textfile as argument and also returns it. 
The subroutine asks a user to input some text. The text is inserted
at the end of the file. Optional: the user is also asked for the
line where the text will be inserted.
<p>

<h3>Local and Global Variables</h3>

<font color=blue>
my ($number)=0;<br>
local ($string)="";
</font>
<p>

Each subroutine should use its own set of variables so that
the different subroutines do not interfere with each other.
"Global variables" are variables that are used in the main routine
and in subroutines. In the previous script $file and @textfile are
global variables. But in the subroutines they are renamed
to $inputfile, $outputfile and @text. All variables in subroutines
should be defined with "my".
<p>
Variables declared with "local" are visible in the subroutine and 
all subroutines that are called from the subroutine. 
<p>
If "use strict" is used, global variables are not permitted. In that
case all variables must be sent to subroutines using the @_ array.
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b>
<p>
Modify the previous example so that the user is asked for his/her
first name, last name, email address. The information is stored
in the file in the following format:<br>
Mary | Smith | mary@somecompany.com<br>
John | Miller | miller@somecompany.com<br>
<br>
A fourth subroutine is added that asks a user for her/his last name and 
retrieves the email address from the file. To do that every line of the
file is
split into an array. The second element in that array is compared to
the current user's last name.
