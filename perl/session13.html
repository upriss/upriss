<TITLE>L548: Session 13</Title>

<body>
<h3>Object-oriented programming I</h3>

Notes: 1) The exercises on this page use the pseudo-code "ezperl". Currently
ezperl is only available on ella. Click <a href="session13a.html">here</a>
if you would like to see the Perl code and optional materials.
<p>
2) Type "ezperl filename" on ella. Ezperl creates a perl file called
filename.plx and executes it. If you should get error messages, they
refer to the perl file and not the pseudo-code. That means line numbers
may be incorrect. (Ask the instructor for help.)
<p>
3) Ezperl expects one command per line. If you want to extend a command
over several lines add a backward slash (\) at the end of every line to
be continued.

<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
Add further attributes to the  student class (phone number, email address, 
degree, etc). Note: you need "\@" instead of "@" in the email address.
(That's Perl's fault not Ezperl's!)
<p>
Create an array of students. Let users add new students to the array.
Ask the user for the name of a student and then print his/her details.
<p>
Create a method creditHours  that computes the number of credit hours
for a student assuming that every class is a three credit class.
(Note: Ezperl does not support special variables such as $#array.
The length of an array can be obtained by using it in a scalar
context - same as in Perl.)
<p>
Create a class Employee that contains information
about names, ages and positions. What could be useful methods
for the class?
