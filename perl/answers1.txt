2) Write a program that asks two people for their names; stores the 
names in variables called $name1 and $name2; says hello to both of them. 

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
#
# A program for greeting people
#
print "What is your name? ";
$name1 = <STDIN> ;
chomp ($name1);
print "What is your name? ";
$name2 = <STDIN> ;
chomp ($name2);
print "Hello, $name1 and $name2! How are you?\n";    

3) Write a script that asks a user for a number. The script adds 3 to 
that number. Then multiplies the result by 2, subtracts 4, subtracts 
twice the original number, adds 3, then prints the result. 

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
#
# Magically guessing a number
#
print "Please, type in a number: ";
$number = <STDIN>;
chomp ($number);

$newresult = (($number + 3) * 2) - 4;
$finalresult = $newresult - (2 * $number) + 3;

print "The result is $finalresult.\n";
