<h3>CGI - Common Gateway Interface</h3>

<h3>A simple CGI script</h3>

CGI scripts do not run on any webserver. In SLIS, CGI scripts run
on "ella". The following instructions are correct for ella.
Other servers may be set up slightly differently.
On ella you should create two directories: "www" and a subdirectory
of "www" called "cgi". Both directories should be world readable
and executable. All html files should be in the www directory,
all cgi files in the cgi directory. The URL for
the html files is<br>
<font color=blue>http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~username/filename</font>.
The URL for cgi files is<br>
<font color=blue>http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~username/cgi/filename</font>
<br>
(Instead of putting the cgi files into the cgi directory they can
also be located somewhere else. But then they must be given a
".cgi" extension.)
<p>

<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
1) Save some simple html code such as
<p>
<font color=blue>
&#60HTML&#62<BR>
&#60HEAD&#62<BR>
&#60TITLE&#62
Hello World&#60/TITLE&#62<BR>
&#60/HEAD&#62<BR>
&#60BODY&#62<BR>
&#60H1&#62Greetings&#60/H1&#62<BR>
&#60/BODY&#62<BR>
&#60/HTML&#62<BR>
</font>
as a file in your www directory on ella. Look at it through a browser.

<p>

2) Save some simple cgi code such as
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/perl -Tw<br>
#<br>
# CGI<br>
#<br>
use CGI qw(:standard);<br>
print header();<br>
print "&#60HTML&#62<BR>
&#60HEAD&#62<BR>
&#60TITLE&#62Hello World&#60/TITLE&#62<BR>
&#60/HEAD&#62<BR>
&#60BODY&#62<BR>
&#60H1&#62Greetings&#60/H1&#62<BR>
&#60/BODY&#62<BR>
&#60/HTML&#62";<BR>
</font>           
in your cgi directory. Run "perl -T" on it to check the syntax.
Change file permissions to executeable ("chmod 700 filename"
or "chmod u+x filename").
Look at it through your browser.
<p>
<font color=red>It is quite possible that you now see a page "Internal 
Server Error". To find the problem: on ella you can run a script 
called "checkcgi" that might give you hints. Otherwise go through
the steps listed below.</font>
<p>
Notes: 1) "print header()" is the same as
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n"; but it leads to fewer mistakes.<br>
2) The -T switch in the commandline (#!/usr/bin/perl -Tw) is for
security purposes. 

<h3>Tips for dealing with an "Internal Server error":</h3>
1) The first line of the script must contain the perl command 
(#!/usr/bin/perl)<br>
2) The line "use CGI qw(:standard);" must be somewhere at the beginning.<br>
3) The very first print statement of your script must be 
"print header();"<br>
4) The file permissions must be set to executable (chmod u+x filename).<br>
5) The script should be executed by typing "perl -T filename" on the 
command line to check the syntax.<br>

<h3>Processing forms with CGI</h3>

Normal HTML:
<p>
<table border=1>

<tr><td><b>browser</b><td><b>server</b>
<tr><td>user requests <br>
html document <td>
<tr><td><td> server finds HTML file <br>
 and sends page back
</table>
<p>
CGI:
<p>
<table border =1>
<tr><td><b>browser</b><td><b>server</b>
<tr><td>user requests  <br> a form <td>
<tr><td><td>      server finds the HTML form <br>
 and sends it back to user
<tr><td>user fills out form <td>
<tr><td><td>         CGI application executes<br>
 program and sends results<br>
 back to user
</table>
<p>
<b>Exercises</B>
<p>

A sample form looks like this:
<p>
<font color=blue>
&#60form action="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~username/cgi/example" 
method="post"&#62 <p>
&#60input type="radio" name="drink" value="tea" checked &#62   
Tea &#60br&#62 <br>
&#60input type="radio" name="drink" value="coffee" &#62 Coffee &#60br&#62 <br>
&#60input type="radio" name="drink" value="hot chocolate" &#62 Hot Chocolate
&#60p&#62 <p>
&#60input type="submit" value="Place order"&#62 <br>
&#60/form&#62 <p>
</font>

3) Include the form in an html document on ella (don't forget to 
change the URL of the form action so that it points to your 
cgi directory).

<p>
This is the source code of a cgi file that processes the form:
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/bin/perl -Tw<br>
use CGI qw(:standard);<br>
<br>
print header();<br>
print "&#60html&#62<br>
&#60head&#62<br>
        &#60title&#62 Tea is served&#60/title&#62<br>
&#60/head&#62<br>
&#60body&#62<br>
&#60hr&#62&#60h1&#62 Tea&#60/h1&#62&#60hr&#62<br>
&#60p&#62";<br><br>
my $drink = param("drink");<br><br>
if ($drink eq "tea") {print "You requested tea.";}<br>
elsif ($drink eq "coffee"){print "You requested coffee.";}<br>
elsif ($drink eq "hot chocolate"){print "You requested hot chocolate.";}<br>
else {print "An error occured.";}<br>
print "  <br>
&#60p&#62<br>
Thank you for your visit. Please come again. <br>
&#60p&#62<br>
&#60hr&#62<br>
&#60/body&#62<br>
&#60/html&#62<br>
";<br>
</font>
<br>
4) Save the cgi file. Run Perl on it to check
for syntax errors. It will ask you to input parameters manually.
Type "drink=tea" then "enter" and then hit Control-D.
Then check to see if it works via the browser.
<p>
5) Add a checkbox to the form (such as "Do you want milk? Yes/No")
and a text area where customers can type in what kind of cake they
would like to order.
Change your cgi script so that it includes these in its reply,
such as "you requested tea with milk", "sorry we are out of
chocolate cake". The checkbox and text area must have distinct
names in the form. Their parameters are retrieved in the cgi file
by using the "param()" function.

<h3>CGI without forms</h3>

The parameters that are passed to a CGI file do not need to come from
a form. They can also be added to the URL in the following manner:
<br>
<font color=blue>
&#60A HREF="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~upriss/cgi/example?drink=tea"&#62
</font>
<br>
Several parameters can be passed to a CGI file. 
They are separated by a &amp symbol. No space is allowed after the "?".
Blanks should be represented by "+".
<br>
<font color=blue>
&#60A HREF="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~upriss/cgi/example?drink=hot+chocolate"&#62
</font>
<p>

<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
6) Try using your cgi file by adding the parameters to the URL.
See what happens if the parameters are not tea or coffee or
hot chocolate.
<p>
7) Write an HTML file that does not contain a form but 
contains three links that send URLs with attached parameters
"tea", "coffee", "hot chocolate" to the cgi file. (In this
manner you can write cgi files that communicate with other 
cgi files on the web.)
<p>
8) (optional) Choose a search engine on the web and analyse how
they attach the search paramaters to the URL. Write a form that
sends data to that search engine.
