4) What is the difference between the following expressions?

b) !/yes/ and /[^y][^e][^s]/ 

!/yes/ matches lines that do not contain the string "yes".

/[^y][^e][^s]/ matches lines that contain three characters so that
the first one is not "y", the second one is not "e", and the third one
is not "s". Eg. "yes" or "yeS" or "yyy" are not matched, but
"YES" or "yes!" are matched (because "es!" does not equal "yes").
