<h3>1) A first example "Hello World"</h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# This program says "hello" to the world<br>
#<br>
print "Hello World!\n";<br>
</font>
<p>
To execute the perl script copy the blue text from the screen
and paste it into a file. Save the file, for example, under the
name "hello". Then type at the Unix prompt:

<font color=blue>
<p>
perl hello
<p>
</font>
<p>

<b>Explanations</b>
<table border=1>
<tr><td># <td>indicates a comment;  the line is ignored
<tr><td>print <td> a command; prints the string between the quotes
<tr><td>\n<td> newline character
<tr><td>; <td> indicates the end of a command
</table>
<p>
<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
1) Add a second print statement to the script from the example.
(For example print "How are you?".)
What does adding or deleting "\n" change?
<p>
2) Make some random changes, for example, delete the "#" before
"This program says ..."; delete the semicolon after "World\n"; etc.
In most cases you will get an error message. The only useful piece
of information in that message is probably the number of the line in
which the error occurred. Fix the errors until the script executes again
successfully.
<p>
3) Type "perl -v" at the command line. It gives you information
about the specific version of Perl that is installed on the computer.<br>
Type "man perl" at the command line. It provides you with on-line
help. (Don't try to read it right now - it's too technical. Just
keep in mind that it's there in case you need it later in the semester.)
To exit "man perl" type "q" or Ctrl-c.

<h3>2) A second example </h3>

<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# A program for greeting people<br>
#<br>
print "What is your name? ";<br>
$name = &#60STDIN&gt ;<br>
chomp ($name);<br>
print "Hello, $name! How are you?\n";<br>
</font>
<p>

<b>Explanations</b>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>$name <td> a variable for a "name"
<tr><td> = <td> an assignment operator
<tr><td> &#60STDIN&#62  <td> reads from standard input (i.e. keyboard)
<tr><td> chomp <td> deletes the newline character ("enter" key)
</table>
<p>            

<b>Exercises:</b><p>
1) What happens if you delete the line with "chomp"?
<br>
2) Write a program that
asks two people for their names; stores the names in variables
called $name1 and $name2; says hello to both of them.

<h3>Operators for Numbers</h3>

<font color=blue>
$a = 3 -4 +10;<br>
$b = 5*6;<br>
$c = 7/8;<br>
print "These are the values: $a $b $c \n";<br>
print "Increment $a by one: ";<br>
$a++;<br>
print $a;<br>
print "\n";<br>
print "Decrease $a by one: ";<br>
$a--;<br>
print $a;<br>
print "\n";     
</font>      
<p>

<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
1) Execute the script. Make sure you understand every line.
<br>
2) What is the value of $a and $b after each of the following
statements? 
<br>
$a=5; $b=10;<br>
$a++;<br>
$b--;$b--;$b++;<br>
$a = $a + $b; <br>
$b = $a; <br>
$a--; <br>
3) Write a script that asks a user for a number. The script
adds 3 to that number. Then multiplies the result by 2, subtracts 4,
subtracts twice the original number, adds 3, then prints
the result.

<h3>Optional exercise</h3>

To execute a perl script 
you can also change the program permissions to executable

<font color=blue>
<p>
chmod u+x program_name
<p>           
</font>

and then execute it by simply typing the program_name.
