<h3>Perl and Networking</h3>

Protocols<p>
Bottom layers: physical network, IP, TCP <br>
Top layers: FTP, telnet, http<p>
Type of connection: connection-oriented vs. packet-oriented

<h3>Connecting to the http port</h3>

In this script "$remote" is a variable for a two directional socket
handle (similar to a filehandle, which is usually one directional).
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>
use IO::Socket;<br>
<br>
$current_host = "www.slis.indiana.edu";<br>
$current_doc = "/";<br>
<br>
$remote =IO::Socket::INET->new(Proto => "tcp",<br>
PeerAddr => $current_host,<br>
PeerPort => "http(80)",<br>
);<br>
if (!$remote) {die "cannot connect to http daemon on $current_host"}<br>
$remote->autoflush(1);<br>
print $remote "GET $current_doc HTTP/1.0\n\n";<br>
$line = &#60$remote&#62 ; <br>
while ($line) {<br>
print "$line";<br>
$line = &#60$remote&#62 ; <br>
}<br>
close $remote;<br>
</font>
<p>
<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
Try the script using pages you know. Notice the text that is 
printed before the "&#60;html&#62;" tag. What happens if the
filename is incomplete (for example compare "php.indiana.edu/~upriss"
and "php.indiana.edu/~upriss/")? What happens if there exists no
file at the requested URL. 
<p>
Print the output to a file and then view the file through your browser.
<p>
Using a regular expression to omit the header information and print
only the lines that follow the  "&#60;html&#62;" tag.
<p>
Turn the script into a subroutine. In a main routine save three
hostnames and document names each into an array. Let the main routine
call the subroutine three times using each hostname/document name
pair once. Don't use global variables but instead pass
$current_host and $current_doc as arguments to the subroutine.


<h3>Connecting to other CGI sites</h3>

To connect to another CGI script on the web you can submit the 
information that the script requires via the URL and then 
display the result through your CGI script.
For example, type<br>
http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=WORD<br>
into the URL field  of your browser and replace WORD by a topic you want
to retrieve. 
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
Incorporate this into the 
"connecting to http ports" script from above. Let the user input a topic. 
Display the result without the advertisements.
<p>
Note: it may be illegal to incorporate other CGI scripts
into your script without asking the owner of the original script
for permission. At a minimum you would have to inform users about
the underlying script. 
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
Review what you have learned about processing forms with CGI so far.

<h3>Optional: Connecting to the ftp port</h3>

You need to fill in your email address before you start the script.
This script is only an example of how to use the IO::Socket. For 
serious implementation the NET::FTP module should be used. Another
possibility would be to use the http protocol.

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
use IO::Socket;<br>
<br>
$current_host ="ftp.uwsg.indiana.edu";<br>
$email_address ="user\@indiana.edu";<br>
<br>
$remote =IO::Socket::INET->new(Proto => "tcp",<br>
PeerAddr => $current_host,<br>
PeerPort => "ftp(21)",<br>
);<br>
if (!$remote) { die "cannot connect to http daemon on $current_host"}<br>
$remote->autoflush(1);<br>
print $remote "USER anonymous\n";<br>
print $remote "PASS $email_address\n";<br>
print $remote "quit\n";<br>
while (&#60$remote&#62)<br>
{print;}<br>
close $remote;<br>
