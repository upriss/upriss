<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
1) You can also print all environment variables using the following 
code (try it).<br>
foreach $elem (keys %ENV) {<br>
    print "$elem $ENV{$elem}&#60;br&#62;";<br>
}  <br>
<p>
2) Use one of the CGI scripts that you have created earlier in this
semester. Include a print statement in the CGI script that 
prints the environment variables REQUEST_METHOD, QUERY_STRING 
and CONTENT_LENGTH. Note: that some of these are only available if the
method for sending the form is "get", others are only available if the
method is "post". (Check the <br>
&#60;form action=... method=... &#62; tag in your form.)
REQUEST_METHOD and CONTENT_LENGTH can be used to 
increase the security of your script. CONTENT_LENGTH
should not be longer than a predefined maximum length. 

<h3>Maintaining State</h3>

If one form invokes another form, it is often the case that information
from the first form must be send to the second form. This is part of 
"maintaining state", i.e. maintaining accurate information between
different CGI scripts invoked by one user. There are three possibilities
to maintain state: <br>
a) send hidden text, <br>
b) write information to a file (on the server),<br>
c) set cookies (on the client). <br>

<h3>Hidden text</h3>

<b>Exercise</b>:
<p>
3) Create a form that asks a user for his/her name and some comments.
Then create two CGI scripts that create a response. The first script
displays the information which the user has submitted ("Hello $name.
These are your comments: $comments") and asks the user whether he/she
really wants to submit the information. The second script is invoked
by the first one and displays "Thank you $name. Your comments 
have been submitted: $comments".
<p>
To implement this add a form and hidden tags to the first CGI script,
such as
<p><font color=blue>
&#60;input type='hidden' name='hiddenname' value=\"$name\"&#62;<br>
&#60;input type='hidden' name='hiddencomments' value=\"$comments\"&#62;
</font><p>
The second CGI script retrieves these strings via
<p><font color=blue>
my $name = param('hiddenname');<br>
my $comments = param('hiddencomments');
</font><p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<b>Exercise</b>
<p>
4) Use a cookie instead of hidden text in the previous exercise.
<p>
The following code in the first CGI script sets a cookie.

<p><font color=blue>
$cookiedata = $name."|".$comments;<br>
$cookie = cookie(-name=>'nameandcomments',-value=>"$cookiedata",
                     -expires=>'+1h');<br>
print header(-cookie=>$cookie);  <br>
</font><p>

The second CGI script retrieves the cookie similarly to retrieving
parameters:

<p><font color=blue>
$cookiedata = cookie(-name=>'nameandcomments');<br>
($name, $comments) = split(/\|/,$cookiedata);
<p></font>

<h3>Writing to a file</h3>

<b>Exercise (optional)</b>:
<p>
5) Instead of using hidden tags, save the information to a file. 
<p>
There are several problems involved with saving to a file because
several users can look at the CGI script at the same time. To 
keep track of which user wrote which comments, write user name
and comments to the file; send the user name as hidden text and 
use the name to retrieve the correct comments from the file.
<p>
A file that is written to should be locked to prevent the file from 
getting corrupted.
<p>
<font color=blue>
flock(FILEHANDLE,2) || die("cannot flock $!"); 
</font>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
<p>
6) A hit counter: create a file that contains
only the number "0". Your CGI script must open that file for reading;
read the first line of the file into a scalar variable; increase the 
number by one; close the file; open the file again for writing (not
appending); write the number to the file; close the file.
