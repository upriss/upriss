1a) Write a script that asks users for the temperature in F and 
prints the temperature in C. (Conversion: Celsius = (F - 32) * 5/9 )

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
#
# This program converts F to C
#
print "What is the termperature in degrees F?";
$F = <STDIN> ;
chomp $F;
$C=(($F-32)*(5/9));
print "The termperature in C is $C\n";

2a) Write Perl print statements for the following text: 

print "Snoopy bought a CD called \"Greatest Hits\" on the WWW for\n";
print "\$10.00. To buy the CD he had to send an email message to\n";
print "orders\@hits-online.net. This is what the design on the CD\n";
print "cover looked like:\n\n";
print "\t\\  |  /\n";
print "\t  \@ \@\n";
print "\t   *\n";
print "\t \\---/\n";


3b) Write a program that asks users for their favourite color. 
Create the following output (assuming "red" is the chosen color). 

red red red red red red red red red red  
red                                      red
red                                      red
red red red red red red red red red red

Hints: For the first and last lines: concatenate the string 
with "." and use the x-operator. For the second and third line use "\t". 


#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
#
# program that demonstrates operating with strings
#
print "Please, type your favourite color: ";
$color= <STDIN> ;
chomp $color;
$color = $color . " ";
$color2 = $color x 10;
print "$color2\n";
print "$color\t\t\t\t\t$color\n";
print "$color\t\t\t\t\t$color\n";
print "$color2\n";


5) Modify the program so that it answers "That is great!" if the answer 
was "yes", "That is disappointing" if the answer was "no" and "That is not 
an answer to my question." otherwise. 

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
#
# if statement
#
print "Do you like Perl? ";
$answer = <STDIN> ;
chomp $answer;
if ($answer eq "yes")
        {print "That is great!\n";}
elsif ($answer eq "no")
	{print "That is disappointing!\n";}
else
 	{print "That is not an answer to my question.\n";}
