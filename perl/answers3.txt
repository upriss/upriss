3a) Write a script that asks someone to input their first name, last name 
and phone number. If the user does not type at least some characters for 
each of these, print "Do not leave any fields empty" otherwise print "Thank 
you". 

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

print "Please, type in your first name: ";
$fname = <STDIN> ;
chomp $fname;
print "Please, type in your second name: ";
$lname = <STDIN> ;
chomp $lname;
print "Please, type in your phone number: ";
$phone = <STDIN> ;
chomp $phone;
if (not ($fname and $lname and $phone)) {
     print "Do not leave any fields empty\n";
}
else {
     print "Thank you!\n";
}  

3b) Change the script so that the script prints "Thank you" if either the 
first name or the last name or the phone number is supplied. Print "Do not 
leave all fields empty" otherwise. 

if ($fname or $lname or $phone) {
     print "Thank you!\n";
}
else {
     print "Do not leave all fields empty\n";
}

3c) Change the script so that only first name and last name are required. 
The phone number is optional. 

if ($fname and $lname) {
     print "Thank you!\n";
}
else {
     print "Do not leave any fields empty\n";
}


Write a program that asks a user to input a color.  If the color is
black or white, output "The color was black or white". If it starts
with a letter that comes after "k" in the alphabet, output "The color
starts with a letter that comes after "k" in the alphabet".


#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
#
# if statement
#
print "Please enter a color: ";
$answer = <STDIN> ;
chomp $answer;
if (($answer eq "black") or ($answer eq "white"))
        {print "The color was black or white.\n";}
elsif ($answer gt "k")
	{print "The color starts with a letter that comes after \"k\" in the alphabet.\n";}


Write a program that asks a user to input a number.  If the number
equals "5", output "My lucky number". If the number is not "5", output
"That's not my lucky number." If the number is larger than 10, output
"What a large number!".


#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
#
# if statement
#
print "\nPlease enter a number:";
$answer = <STDIN> ;
chomp $answer;
if ($answer eq "5")
	{print "My lucky number.\n";}
elsif ($answer > 10)
        {print "What a large number!\n";}
else
        {print "That's not my lucky number.\n";}



Optional Material:

a) if ($a++ and $b++) {}

Observation: If the first variable is 0 then only the first variable is 
increased by one, otherwise both variables are increased by one.

Explanation: Perl looks at the expression from left to right. If the first part is 
zero, Perl does not even look at the second part because an expression
with "and" is always false if the first part is false. Therefore only $a++ is
executed, not $b++.

b) if ($a++ or $b++) {}

Observation: If the first variable is 1 then only the first variable is
increased by one, otherwise both variables are increased by one.

Explanation: Perl looks at the expression from left to right. If the first part is 
not zero, Perl does not even look at the second part because an expression
with "or" is true if the first part is true. Therefore only $a++ is
executed, not $b++.
