<font color=blue>There is a newer version of these materials available
<a href="../perlcgi/32037.html">here</a>.</font>
<p>
This is a generic version of a class "Computer Programming for Information
Management" that I taught twice a year at the 
<a href="http://www.slis.indiana.edu">
School of Library and Information Science</a>, Indiana University Bloomington.
The materials in this course are mostly self-explanatory and can be
used for self study. (There are some references in the materials to
Indiana University accounts and settings which should be ignored.)
It will probably take several weeks to work
through the materials. For shorter introductions to Perl see Nik Silver's
<an href="http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/Perl/start.html">Perl Tutorial</an> or
Selena Sol's
<an href="http://wdvl.com/Authoring/Languages/Perl/5/toc.html">Introduction
to Perl 5</an>.
<p>
Notes: 1) I created most of the exercises in this course myself but 
some of the examples are based on the
<an href="http://agora.leeds.ac.uk/Perl/start.html">Perl Tutorial</an>, the 
<an href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl2/">Learning Perl</an> Book and
<an href="http://wdvl.com/Authoring/Languages/Perl/5/toc.html">
Introduction to Perl 5</an>. The materials in this course are copyrighted.
<p>
2) Please only contact me 
in case you found errors in the text or have comments. Please,
don't contact me with questions about how to solve the exercises.
<p>
3) I will not be responsible for any possible damage that any of the
scripts and exercises in this course may have. This holds especially
for CGI scripts that may pose security risks on a web server. It is
up to the person who uses any of the materials in this course,
to use the materials in a safe environment and to keep up to date
with CGI security recommendations (the ones in Week 11 
are probably not sufficient).
