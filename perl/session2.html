<b>1) Operators for Numbers</b>
<p>
<font color=red>
$a = $b; ##### Assign $b to $a<br>
$a = 7.84e45 ##### 7.84 times 10 to the 45th power<br>
$a = 1 + 2; ##### Add 1 and 2 and store in $a<br>
$a = 3 - 4; ##### Subtract 4 from 3 and store in $a<br>
$a = $a + $b; ##### Add $b to $a<br>
$a = 5 * 6; ##### Multiply 5 and 6<br>
$a = 7 / 8; ##### Divide 7 by 8 to give 0.875<br>
$a = 9 ** 10; ##### Nine to the power of 10<br>
$a = 5 % 2; ##### Remainder of 5 divided by 2<br>
$a++;	##### Increment $a by one<br>
$a--;	##### Decrement $a by one<br>

<b>Exercise: Operating with Numbers</b>
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
# <br>
# This program converts from US $ to Canadian $<br>
# <br>
print "Money value in US \$ ";<br>
$us_money = &#60;STDIN&#62; ;<br>
chomp $us_money;<br>
$can_money = $us_money /0.6;<br>
print "US\$ $us_money = Canandian \$ $can_money\n";<br>
</font>
<p>

a) In analogy to the example, write a script that 
asks users for the temperature in F
and prints the temperature in C. (Conversion: 
Celsius = (F - 32) * 5/9 )<br>
<p>

<b>2) Strings</b>
<p>
A string is delimited by double quotes (""). Certain special characters
can be used, such as "\n" and "\t". Variables are interpreted, i.e.
'print "$name"' prints the value of '$name' and not $-sign followed by
'name'. To print the characters $, ", \, @, they must be preceded
by a backslash (\). 
<p>
<font color=blue>
print "hello\n";<br>
print "hello\\n";<br>
print "\$5.00\n";<br>
print "She said: \"hello\"\n"; <br>
print "\tThis is indented\n"; <br>
$a = "apples"; $b = "pears"; <br>
print "$a and $b\n"; <br>
</font>
<p>
<b>Exercise:</b>
<p>
a) Write Perl print statements for 
the following text (with the same linebreaks, etc):
<p>
Snoopy bought a CD called "Greatest Hits" on the WWW for <br>
$10.00. To buy the CD he had to send an email message to <br>
orders@hits-online.net. This is what the design on the CD <br>
cover looked like:
<p>
<pre>
       \  |  /
         @ @
          *
        \---/
</pre>

<p>

<b>3) Operators and functions for strings</b>

<p>
<font color=red>
chop $a; ##### removes the last character<br>
chomp $a; ##### removes the last character if it is a newline character<br>
$a = $b . $c; ##### concatenate $b and $c<br>
$a = $b x $c; ##### $b repeated $c times<br>
</font>

<p>
Example:
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w <br>
# <br>
# program that demonstrates operating with strings<br>
#<br>
print "Please, type your favourite color: ";<br>
$color= &#60;STDIN&#62;;<br>
chomp $color;<br>
$color = $color . "***";<br>
chop $color; chop $color;<br>
$color = $color . "!";<br>
$color = $color x 5;<br>
print "$color\n";
</font>
<p>
a) Add 'print "$color\n";' after every line so that you can see how
the content of the variable is changed after each step. 
<p>
b) Write a program that asks users for their favourite
color. Create the following output (assuming "red" is the chosen
color). 

<pre>
red red red red red red red red red red  
red 					 red
red 					 red
red red red red red red red red red red
</pre>

Hints: For the first and last lines: concatenate the string with
"." and use the x-operator. For the second and third line use 
"\t".
<p>
<b>4) Debugging</b>
<p>
Adding print statements for variables can be a good strategy
to <b>debug</b> a piece of code. For example, the following piece
of code is mostly nonsense. Do not try to understand it! But
if you add 'print "$color\n";' after every line, you can identify
the line which changes the variable to a number. Delete that line
and the output will contain another color. (This shows that it is 
sometimes possible to use a piece of code without fully understanding
every symbol in it - as long as you know what every line does!)
<p>
<font color="blue">
$color= "red" || die;<br>
chop $color if 1;<br>
$color = "g".$color . "en";<br>
0 && chomp $color;<br>
$color = $color . "!";<br>
$color = print "";<br>
$color = $color x 5;<br>
print "$color\n";<br>
</font>
<p>

<b>5) Control structures: if</b>
<p>
This is just a first introduction to control structures. They will
be covered in more detail during the next two weeks.
<p>
<font color=blue>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br>
#<br>
# if statement<br>
#<br>
print "Do you like Perl? ";<br>
$answer = &#60;STDIN&#62;;<br>
chomp $answer;<br>
if ($answer eq "yes"){<br>
print "That is great!\n";<br>
}<br>
else {<br>
print "That is disappointing!\n";<br>
}
<p>
</font>

<b>Exercises</b>
<p>
Modify the program so that it answers "That is great!" if the
answer was "yes", "That is disappointing"
if the answer was "no" and "That is not an answer to my question."
otherwise. Use "if ... elsif ... else ...". Note that "if" and
"elsif" are followed by an expression in parenthesis () and then
a statement in curly brackets {}, "else" is followed only by a statement
in curly brackets.
