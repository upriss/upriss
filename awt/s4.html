<h3>1 Server-side security</h3>

In order to make scripts secure, all user input must be carefully checked.
The best way to check user input is by writing regular expressions
which specify the exact pattern of the expected input. This will
be further explored in Week 8 <!-- -->. This tutorial focussed on understanding
the risks and applying simple checks.

<h4>Exercises</h4>

1.1 Directory indexing and path traversal: <br>
Login to your DCS account. Create a new directory under your public_html
and change its permission (chmod 755). Create a file in that directory.
Then look at that directory through your browser. Can you see which
files are in the directory? Create a file called index.html in that
directory. Look again at the directory through your browser.
<p>
1.2 HTML injection: <br>
Create a simple web form with a textfield and
a simple script that prints the user input from the textfield. (You
can use the script from Week 2 for this exercise if you still have it.)
Apply no security at this stage. Try entering text with html tags
into the textfield (for example "&#60;i&#62;hello&#60;/i&#62;") and see what happens.
<p>
1.3 Defacing: <br>
Continuing from the previous exercise, enter an image tag 
(&#60;img src='...' &#62;)
with a valid URL into the textfield. See what happens.
<br>
In order to fix these basic security risks: if you are using PHP, apply
functions, such as htmlspecialchars() and strip_tags(),
and observe what they do. <br>
If you are using Perl, apply the following code
(assuming that $textfield is the content from the textfield) 
<font color=blue>$textfield =~ s/&#60;/&amp;#60;/g; 
$textfield =~ s/&#62;/&amp;#62;/g;</font>.
These regular expressions will be explained later in the semester.
<p>
1.4 GET and POST requests: <br>
Change the method on your form to GET and then to POST. In each case, observe
what happens. While the form method is GET, observe how the query string
changes. Edit the query string while it is displayed in the browser and press
enter. While the form method is POST, add a print statement to your script
that prints the Content_Length environment variable (for PHP:
<font color=blue>
echo "\$_SERVER['CONTENT_LENGTH'] = ". $_SERVER['CONTENT_LENGTH'];</font>
for Perl: <font color=blue>print "CONTENT_LENGTH is $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'}";</font>)

<h3>2 Mini browser</h3>

The following code is a Perl script that acts as a "mini browser" and
allows raw data exchange with an HTTP server. Save the file as "webget.pl". 
Then run the script on the Unix command-line by typing, for example, 

<font color=blue><pre>
perl webget.pl www.dcs.napier.ac.uk /index.html | more
</pre></font>

Note that the slash (/) in front of the document is necessary. Host and
document must be separated by a space. The Unix programs curl or wget
can also be used in this manner, but the advantage of webget.pl for security
testing is that it is raw code and easy to modify. 

<font color=blue><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use IO::Socket;
unless (@ARGV > 1) {die "usage: $0 host document ..."}
$host = shift (@ARGV);
foreach $document (@ARGV){
        $remote =IO::Socket::INET->new(Proto => "tcp",
        PeerAddr => $host,
        PeerPort => "http(80)",
        );
        unless ($remote) { die "cannot connect to http daemon on $host"}
        $remote->autoflush(1);
        print $remote "GET $document HTTP/1.0\n";
        print $remote "Host: $host\n";
	print $remote "\n";
        while (<$remote>) {print}
        close $remote;
}
</pre></font>

<h4>Exercises</h4>

2.1 Try this mini browser on a variety of websites. Instead of "/index.html"
use "/" or another document. Try it on some of your own websites.
Try it on a site that sets cookies. 
<p>
2.2 Add a seurity requirement to one of your own scripts that tests 
HTTP_REFERER and exits if the REFERER is not the correct form.
Then add "REFERER: ..." to webget.pl in order to pretend to come from
the correct form. (In this case, really "REFERER" and not "HTTP_REFERER".)


<h4>Exercises: Check the security of your own pages</h4>

3.1 Unix security:<br>
Ask the person who is sitting next to you what their matric number is
and tell them what is yours. Then
have a look at their files through your account on DCS. Talk to them about 
what they can see in your DCS directory. If you don't like the level
of security of your files, then change it.
Your top level directory must have execute permission for others, but it does 
not require read permission for others. Only the files in public_html
must have read permission for others. All your other files and directories
can be protected from other users on the same machine!
<p>
3.2 PHP/Perl security of your own files:<br>

Have a look at the security of the script files that you created so far.
Which of them are secure? If you have insecure files which you created
during previous tutorials, it is best to remove the execute permission of these
files at the end of the tutorials. Make sure that your directories
which contain scripts cannot be listed via a browser.
<p>
3.3 Security of your files for the coursework:<br>
If you are using PHP on DCS, it will be very difficult to protect your
files from other students' eyes. You might consider changing the execute
permissions each time you logout or using some "security through
obscurity" (i.e. strange filenames and locations). <br>
If you are using Perl, make sure your scripts have permission 700.
