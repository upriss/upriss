<h3>1 Unicode</h3>

The code points of Unicode characters can be looked up in the 
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">Unicode charts</a>
or in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Unicode_Blocks">
this Wikipedia page</a>.

<h4>Exercises</h4>

1.1 Determine what the characters look like which have the 
following Unicode code points (as decimal numbers):<br>
U+9730, U+9731, U+9755, U+9836, U+9859.<br>
Hints: insert them as numeric character references into an HTML
document and look at them through your browser. Hexadecimal
characters have an x before the number, decimal ones don't have an x.
<p>
1.2 Find Unicode characters for smiley faces, the pound sterling 
sign and the euro sign. <br>
Hint: look them up in the name index of the 
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">Unicode charts</a>.
<p>
1.3 Search for Kobenhavn and K&#248;benhavn on an internet search
engine (e.g. Google). Do the two words produce different numbers of websites?
What about searching for Cafe and Caf&eacute;? <br>
Hint: copying and pasting the characters should work on most browsers.
<p>
1.4 Use a PHP or Perl script that you wrote in a previous tutorial.
Test what happens when you copy and paste characters, such as
&#248; or &eacute; into a textfield on such a script. 
Add some code that converts these characters from UTF-8 to numeric
character references and back.
