<h3>Welcome to SET09103 Advanced Web Technologies!</h3>

This first tutorial serves as a preparation. It allows you to
check whether you have all the prerequisite knowledge you need
for this module and whether your computer account is working. 
If you find that you are lacking some prerequisite knowledge,
please, use this week and next week to catch up. If there
are any problems with your Napier computer account, please,
contact C&IT as soon as possible.

<h4>Decide which programming language you want to use</h4>

You can use any programming language of your choice, but only PHP and
Perl will be supported by the lecturer. 

<h4>Check your computer account</h4>

Please, login to the account you want to use for server-side programming. 
and check the following:

<ul>
<li>Do you know how to edit, save webpages and scripts?
<li>Does the programming language you chose run on the server?
<li>Do you know how to access the server remotely (in case you want
to upload files from home)?
</ul>
If you are using the School of Computing (DCS/socweb) server and have
questions about it, have a look
at the <a href="software.html">Unix/telnet help</a>.
(This link is also on the <a href="9103-Fa08.html">module website</a>.)

<h4>Check your programming skills</h4>

Below are two exercises, which help you to get back into web programming
in case you haven't done it for a while. 

<ul>
<li>Create a basic HTML page that contains a web form with one text field
asking a user to enter an amount in dollars.<br>
<li>Write a script that 
converts dollar amounts into pounds. Use a fictional exchange
rate of $ 1  = &#163; 0.5004. Your script should check whether the 
user input is a positive number. If the user enters a value below 0,
the script should print an error message. 
</ul>

If you have problems with the first exercise, 
have a look at the links for "HTML Intro, HTML Tags, HTML Forms" on the
<a href="9103-Fa08.html">module website</a>.
If you cannot complete this exercise during this tutorial, you may not
have sufficient prerequisite knowledge for this module. Please, talk to the
module leader about this.
<p>
If you have problems with the second exercise, do the PHP (or Perl) exercises
for this week (on the <a href="9103-Fa08.html">module website</a>). 
They will remind you how to create scripts. 
If you cannot get any script to work at all during this tutorial, you may not
have sufficient prerequisite knowledge for this module. Please, talk to the
module leader about this.

<h4>Any questions?</h4>

If you have any questions about this module, please, ask Uta Priss (the
module leader). But, please, be patient. In the first tutorial there are
often some problems with students' accounts etc which need to be sorted.
