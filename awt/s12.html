<h3>Protege</h3>

Protege is an open-source ontology editor, which supports a
variety of formats (OWL, RDF, XML Schema). Ontologies are
useful for building Semantic Web applications.
The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a very brief
introduction into what such ontologies look like and
what kinds of operations can be performed on them.

<h4>Instructions for Installation on private PC</h4>

Note: using your own PC is at your own risk. You cannot hold Napier
University responsible if your PC or any of your files get damaged
or deleted, etc.
<p>
<li>You can download and install Protege from 
<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html">here</a>
If you have sufficient disk space you may choose to install the full 
version, otherwise choose the basic version. 
<li>Click on install_protege on your computer. 
<li>After the installation, Protege should be in your Start Menu/Program
files.
<hr>
<h4>Instructions for Installation in JKCC</h4>

If you are unsure about the installation instructions, ask the lecturer
for help before clicking on anything. 
<p>
<li>Open a directory window (eg My Documents). Go to K:\Protege.
Click on install_protege. Choose either H:\Protege or H:\ as the
destination for your installation (you may need to create a Protege
folder first). If you have sufficient
disk space you may choose to install the full version, otherwise install
the basic version. 
<li>After the installation, goto the H:\Protege or H:\ and click on
"Protege jar executable file".
<hr>

<h4>Basic exercises using Protege</h4>

<li>Start Protege; choose the newspaper example.

<li>Have a look at the classes and find out which type of Advertisement
contains a slot called "image".

<li>Using the slots hierarchy, find out what "image" refers to.

<li>Which slots does the class Columnist have that are not inherited
from Employee?

<li>How many instances of advertisements are there? Does any of the
instances actually have an image?

<li>Using the predefined queries, which people have a salary larger
than 100 000?
<p>
This will only work if the full version was installed:

<li>In the top menu, click on Project, then on Configure. Select
the TGVizTab.

<li>Select classes to add, then click on Create Graph. 

<h4>More advanced exercise</h4>

Create a new ontology:

<li>Select a topic that you are familiar with
and that is fairly simple. Examples: an ontology for the Simpson
family (from TV, see <a href="../i200/simpson.jpg">here</a> for
a diagram); or an ontology of pet animals, or ...

<li>Decide which classes, slots and instances you need. 

<li>Enter the information into Protege.
