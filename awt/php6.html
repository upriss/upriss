<h3>Parsing XML with DOM</h3>

The movies file from last week can be used as an example for this week's
exercises. (See the <a href="answer5.txt">answers</a> to last week's exercises.)
The file should be saved as "movies.xml".
In order to read the file, a new instance of DOMDocument is created.
The different methods of DOMDocument can then be used to process the file.
A complete list of the available methods can be found in the 
PHP <a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php">manual</a>.
The example below shows some of the methods being used.
<p>
<font color=blue><pre>
&#60;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc-&#62;load("movies.xml");

echo "If the document is valid, it prints a 1 here:";
echo $doc->validate();
echo "&#60;p&#62;";

echo "The whole document:&#60;br&#62;";
echo $doc-&#62;saveXML();  
echo "&#60;p&#62;";

echo "Document type: ";  
echo $doc-&#62;doctype-&#62;name;
echo "&#60;p&#62;";

echo "The top element: ";
$topElem = $doc-&#62;documentElement;
echo $topElem-&#62;tagName;
echo "&#60;p&#62;";

foreach ($topElem-&#62;childNodes AS $item) {
  if ($item-&#62;nodeType == 1) {
     echo $item-&#62;tagName. " : ";
     foreach ($item-&#62;childNodes AS $bottomItem) {
        if ($bottomItem-&#62;nodeType == 1) {
          echo $bottomItem-&#62;tagName ." = ". $bottomItem-&#62;nodeValue ."; ";
        }
     }
     echo "&#60;br/&#62;";
  }
}
?> 
</pre></font>
<p>
Notes: <br>
1) Space characters in an XML document can lead to the creation
of empty text elements. The if statements (nodeType ==1) above make sure that 
the nodes are element nodes.
<p>

2) It is a good idea to turn error reporting on as a debugging help.
If you want to allow for undefined variables use
<font color=blue>error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);</font> instead. 
Once you are finished with a script, the error_reporting line can be
commented out.

<h3>Exercises</h3>

Note: in order to see the XML output properly, you may need to use
"view source" in your browser for the exercises.
<p>
1) Change the program so that instead of using "childNodes" it uses
"nextSibling" for looping through the nodes.
<p>
2) Quite often it is not necessary to loop through the whole document in
order to find some information. "DOMDocument::getElementsByTagName" returns
a list of elements with that tag name. Print all the titles of the movies
by looping through the nodes which have "title" as their tag name and 
printing their "textContent".
<p>
3) Similar to the previous exercise, find the movie from the year "1998"
and print the textContent of its parentNode.
<p>
4) Read the contents of the XML file into a data structure that contains
the movies and their titles, actor and years. (For simplicity, store
only the first actor of each movie.) Hints: create an array of
movies: "$movies = array();". Create a temporary array for each child node.
When processing the bottomItems, add the tagName/nodeValue pairs to the
temporary array: "$temp[$bottomItem->tagName] = $bottomItem->nodeValue;"
Use "print_r($movies);" to verify the contents of the array. 
<p>
5) Optional exercise: DOM can also be used to create XML documents.
Create a movie element with author, title and year and add it the
movies XML file.

<h3>Parsing XML with SAX</h3>

SAX-based parsing is event-driven. In PHP it is available via the 
xml parser. (See the PHP
<a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/book.xml.php">manual</a>
for details.)
The following example prints tag names, attributes "ID", and content data.

<font color=blue><pre>
&#60;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);
$file = "movies.xml";
    
function startElement($parser, $name, $attrs) { 
    global $depth;
    for ($i = 0; $i &#60; $depth; $i++) {
        echo "&amp;nbsp;";
    }
    echo "$name: {$attrs["ID"]}";
    $depth++;
}
 
function endElement($parser, $name) { 
    global $depth;
    $depth--;
    echo "&#60;p&#62;";
} 

function dataHandler($parser,$data) {
    echo "$data";
 
}

$xml_parser = xml_parser_create();
xml_set_element_handler($xml_parser, "startElement", "endElement");
xml_set_character_data_handler($xml_parser, "dataHandler");
$fp = fopen($file, "r");
    
while ($data = fread($fp, 4096)) {
     xml_parse($xml_parser, $data, feof($fp));
}
xml_parser_free($xml_parser);
?&#62;
</pre></font>

The example below parses an XML file into a data structure. But
this isn't the same sort of data structure as one would use with DOM.

<font color=blue><pre>
&#60;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
$filecontent = implode('', file('movies.xml'));
$p = xml_parser_create();
xml_parse_into_struct($p, $filecontent, $vals, $index);
xml_parser_free($p);
echo "&#60;pre&#62;";
echo "Index array\n";
print_r($index);
echo "\nVals array\n";
print_r($vals);
echo "&#60;/pre&#62;";
?&#62;
</pre></font>


<h3>Exercises</h3>

6) Try the first example. Change the code so that tag names are printed
in italics and the ID attributes are printed in bold face.
<p>
7) Print only the titles of the movies. Hint: use a global variable
that is shared between the startElement and the handler function.
In the startElement this function is set to "true" if it is a title tag,
"false" otherwise.
<p>
8) Try the second example above. Using the $vals array, print only the movie
titles.
<p>
9) Try the SimpleXML below. It converts from
XML to an object and back.

<font color=blue><pre>
&#60;?php
if (file_exists('movies.xml')) {
$xml = simplexml_load_file('movies.xml');
print_r($xml);
print $xml-&#62;asXML();
}
?&#62;
</pre></font>
