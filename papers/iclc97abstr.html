A major difficulty which needs to be overcome in the design of knowledge 
representation systems is the gap between lexical items (with their lexical 
or syntactic relations) and concepts (with their semantic relations). An 
extensive collection of attempts at combining lexical semantics and conceptual 
modeling can be found in Pustejovsky (1993). The most obvious differences 
between the lexical level and the conceptual level are synonymy, homography, 
polysemy, metaphors, and metonymy - all demonstrating structures that exist 
in one level, but not in the other. On the other hand, lexical and conceptual 
structures are also dependent on and complementary to each other. Human 
speakers unconsciously apply a fixed set of lexical items to an open set of 
concepts. Polysemy, metaphor, and metonymy allow speakers, for example, to 
be creative, to relate concepts, and to connote associations to concepts. 
For a computer and for knowledge representation purposes, polysemy, metaphor, 
and metonymy provide difficulties: does each polysemous meaning or each 
metaphorical use of a lexical item represent a new concept which should be 
stored separately or should the polysemous meanings of a lexical item be 
computed according to certain semantic rules? 
<p>
Kilgarriff (1995) develops a graphical representation of lexical and 
conceptual items using the semantic network DATR (Evans & Gazdar, 1989) which 
favours the computation of polysemous meanings. In contrast to Kilgarriff's 
theory we apply Relational Concept Analysis (Priss, 1997) to lexical databases 
and graphically represent polysemous meanings as separate concepts. While the 
DATR modeling seems to be adequate for a computer knowledge base that 
functions without human intervention, the Relational Concept Diagrams are 
easier to comprehend for humans and therefore adequate for human-computer 
interactive systems. Human users gain more control over the lexical and 
semantic relations; updates and consistency checks are made easier. 
Furthermore, the Relational Concept Analysis approach can be utilized to 
visualize relations among metaphorical uses of lexical items. And it 
facilitates insights into the general interrelationships between lexical 
and conceptual structures. This poster will present graphical representations 
of conceptual and lexical structures and their relation to each other
using Relational Concept Analysis. Polysemy and, to some extent, metaphor 
are visualized in their regularities and in their dependency on conceptual 
structures.
