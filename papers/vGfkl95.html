<h2>Conceptual Hierarchies and Meronymy</h2>
Uta Priss

<p>
Formal Concept Analysis, which has been developed at the TH-Darmstadt 
for more than 10 years now, enables a graphical representation of 
conceptual hierarchies using mathematical lattice theory (Wille, 1982).

<p>

The WordNet project tries to build a lexical database which orders the words
corresponding to the mental lexicon. Therefore they collect the words in
synonym sets between which semantical relations hold (Miller, 1990).
Those relations for nouns are synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy and meronymy
where hyponymy and synonymy can be explained with the methods of Formal
Concept Analysis as subconcept-superconcept ordering and equal classification.

<p>

In this talk I will explain the differences between hyponymy and meronymy,
which are both hierarchical classifications of words, and extend the 
methods of Formal Concept Analysis to combine them with relations like
meronymy. I will use that to develop a graphical representation
of a word, its neighbours, and its classification in WordNet.

<p>

The general aim is to deal with different classifications on one set
and to find representations for relations like meronymy, which do not
fulfill the strong conditions for a lattice and in addition have more 
exceptions.
