<h4>Relational Concept Analysis: Semantic Structures in Dictionaries 
and Lexical Databases</h4>

PhD Thesis, Verlag Shaker, Aachen 1998

Relational Concept Analysis is an extension of Formal Concept Analysis. It
combines mathematical lattices with relational structures and provides a 
formal language for the modeling of semantic relations in lexical databases 
and thesauri. The first chapter of this dissertation presents a short 
introduction to Formal Concept Analysis, an overview of the linguistic terminology 
and linguistic or philosophical theories on the subject of `word', `concept', 
`meaning', and `denotation'. This leads to the definition of `disambiguated 
words' which have `particular meanings', are contained or stored in a lexical 
structure, and present the basic units for most of the modelings in this 
dissertation. The concepts that correspond to a disambiguated word are 
differentiated into denotative and connotative word concepts. This 
terminology allows 
the formalization of several `linguistic contexts' and `linguistic lattices' 
which can be applied to a variety of linguistic datasets for a variety of 
purposes. The chapter terminates with formalizations of a traditional 
dictionary, a natural language thesaurus, and a lexical database.

The second chapter introduces Relational Concept Analysis and discusses the 
mathematical formalizations and theorems that apply, such as the development 
of bases for concept relations which allow optimal implementations of 
relations in lexical databases; the inheritance structures and other formal 
properties (such as transitivity) of concept relations; auto- and polyrelations; 
graphical representations; and applications to linguistic contexts and lattices.

The third chapter concentrates on linguistic aspects of semantic relations.
A broad classification of semantic relations is developed based on formal 
characteristics. The semantic relations, synonymy, hyponymy, hypernymy, 
cohyponymy, disjointness, meronymy, contrast (antonymy), sequence, cause, 
backward presupposition, and entailment are formally defined. The major 
example for this chapter is the meronymy relation which is distinguished 
from Lesniewski's mereology. Transitivity of meronymy is discussed. A 
classification of meronymy based on quantifications is developed and 
compared to the 
classifications based on content by other authors. Examples from the lexical 
database WordNet demonstrate how Relational Concept Analysis can be utilized 
to discover irregularities in the implementations of semantic relations in 
lexical databases.

Finally, the last chapter provides further applications and extensions of 
Relational Concept Analysis. It is argued that the lexical and conceptual 
structures of a natural language both form separate systems that interrelate.
A graphical representation technique for semantic and lexical relations in a 
denotative lattice is developed. Formal composition rules for lexical and 
conceptual items are defined and related to each other. Unary relations are 
introduced and used to assign additional attributes to a concept lattice. 
Such additional attributes can be prototypical or default attributes that 
are not shared by all objects in the extent of a concept. The connections of 
Relational Concept Analysis to Relational Algebra, many-valued contexts, the 
Entity-Relationship model, terminological logic, and semantic networks are 
discussed.
