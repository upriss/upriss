<B><P>Introduction</P>
</B><P>The stimulus for this paper was the recent ISKO 2000 conference in Toronto where papers were presented on exotic classification systems (Olson 2000), ecological work-based classification schemes (Albrechtsen 2000; Pejtersen &amp; Albrechtsen 2000) and self-organizing environments (Dron <I>et al</I>. 2000). The world of Pok&eacute;mon combines all three of these approaches to understanding classification. Because the Pok&eacute;mon trading game is heavily merchandised and widely played, it has generated a global cohort of young players who have been introduced to classificatory principles through their participation in the game.  We propose that their understanding of classification should be explored further, as it may provide insight into the appropriation of mediated worlds in other modalities like the web.</P>

<B><P>The world of Pok&eacute;mon</P>
</B><P>The world of Pok&eacute;mon resembles a self-organizing ecology in several respects.  Entities emerge and evolve in response to environmental constraints which more or less follow a set of rules, although contingency is also a feature of this world (e.g., the arbitrary interventions produced by the flip of a coin) .   In the game Pok&eacute;mon, each player wields his own deck of 60 cards consisting of individual Pok&eacute;mon, energy (or life force) cards, and trainers whose intervention can modify or reverse the course of fate.  This deck of cards is constructed by the individual players and functions as a self-organizing ecology that must struggle to survive in the face of interaction with the ecologies of other players. Thus one of the major characteristics of each Pok&eacute;mon is its "HP" or "Hit Point" value, a kind of k-value or fitness rating in the world of Pokemon ecology: a Pok&eacute;mon may be removed from the environment of the game after suffering one or more harmful encounters that exhaust his life force.  To quote form <I>The Official Pok&eacute;mon Handbook</I> (Barbo, 2000), "Pokemon are creatures that come in all shapes, sizes, and personalities. … There are 151 different known species ... Each Pok&eacute;mon is identified by an element.  The element tell you know what kind of characteristics and techniques your Pok&eacute;mon will have … [and] clues you in to which Pok&eacute;mon would do well in a battle against another element" (p. 8-9).  As Barbo observes, the world of Pok&eacute;mon is like a more elaborate and far more complex game  of rock, paper and scissors.</P>

<P>Each deck evolves through trades that a player makes with other Pok&eacute;mon players.  This trading may be carried out on the basis of cash transactions or on the basis of barter.  Values are formally assigned to Pok&eacute;mon cards in a series of 'blue books' or handbooks endorsed by the manufacturer and its marketing network.  To achieve status within the Pok&eacute;mon community of practice, each player must earn badges that are awarded on the basis of points accumulated through winning games against other players.  This allows a player to proceed up a series of achievement levels, each of which endows the player with increasing power in the game. Obviously, there are strong incentives for each player to master the rules and classification structures conducive to the formation of a 'champion' deck.</P>

<B><P>The world of Pok&eacute;mon as a model for classification structure</P>
</B><P>Though the world of Pok&eacute;mon operates on the basis of a general set of rules and an interlocking series of classificatory structures, each individual player's 'world', represented by his personalized deck, remains more or less idiosyncratic since each player's choice of components for the deck will vary on the basis of both his understanding of the consequences of certain combinations (as a function of their experience) and his affinity with the Pok&eacute;mons that he handles.  (The notion of affinity is very important in the computer game version and the official guidebook implies that gender may influence bonding behavior.) The Pok&eacute;mon game thus illustrates a common research problem in classification: the practical consequences of individual classification in contexts that are apparently bound by general or universal schemes.   Our pilot work with key informants, both male and female, indicates that cards may be evaluated for inclusion in a player's deck on the basis of different classificatory principles depending upon the age, sex or experience of the player.</P>

<P>It is our contention that payers' perceptions of and interaction with the classificatory structures embedded in both the Pok&eacute;mon game and other similar games may have important implications for web design.  We suggest that, given the wide range of characteristics exhibited by Pok&eacute;mon cards and our observations of variability in the combination of these characteristics, analysis of the Pok&eacute;mon classificatory structure may lead to identification of a modular classificatory structure that can be applied in other contexts, including instructional exercises and the simulation of practical environments of praxis as well as the construction of other specialized games.  We propose to present on our preliminary work with this research project, including a prototype for a Pok&eacute;mon classification scheme, a brief discussion of its applicability in the design of innovative organizational structures for the web environment and a working example of the use of a Pok&eacute;mon classification scheme as an instructional tool for teaching LIS students about non-traditional classification structures.</P>
